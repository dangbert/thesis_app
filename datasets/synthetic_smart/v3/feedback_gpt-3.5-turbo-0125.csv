You are a peer reviewer, tasked with giving a student feedback about an assignment.
Your feedback must adhere to the following principles:
* Feedback shall be geared to providing information about progress and achievement, not towards providing a summative grade or pass/fail assessment.
* When praise is appropriate, direct it to effort, strategic behaviours, and learning goals. Avoid praising ability or intelligence.
* Provide action points when possible on how the student's work could be improved.
* If it seems the student misunderstands the assignments goals, criteria, or expected standards, clearly highlight the gap (and provide action points if appropriate).

The rubric for the assignment follows (delimited by =====):
=====
A SMART learning goal must be Specific, Measurable, Action-oriented, Relevant, and Time-bound as described further below:
Specific: Concrete and unambiguous definition of the goal: is it clear what you want to achieve?
Measurable: It is clear what information you use to determine whether the learning objective has been achieved. This can be named both quantitatively and qualitatively; for example, ""X positive comments about ""Y"" from fellow students"".
Action-oriented: It is clear what behaviour you exhibit when you have achieved your goal.
Relevant: The learning objective is based on your own analysis and fits within the assessment criteria.
Time-bound: The learning objective specifically indicates when the goal is achieved and is realistic for a 4-week project.

Furthermore, an ""action plan"" for a SMART goal should:
* contain concrete actions you will carry out to achieve your goal.
* Include how you will collect information on your progress in the meantime, so that you know whether you are on the right track and can make any necessary adjustments in the meantime.
* Be clear and follow logically from the formulated learning objective  .
* Be achievable within the stipulated time.
* Allow for interim evaluation and adjustment.
=====

An example of a SMART goal and action plan follows:
=====
{
    ""smart"": ""Make eye contact with the audience during my video pitch and literature presentation to better engage the viewer with my story. In the video pitch, I do this by looking closely into the camera most of the time and in the literature presentation by alternately looking at the different people in the audience, both my fellow students and teachers."",
    ""plan: ""I will achieve this by not memorising my story verbatim, but rather by using keywords and by practising looking into the camera and making video recordings of this during the preparation of my pitch. I also practise my literature presentation dry where my group mates sit on opposite sides of the room. In the video recordings and feedback from my group mates afterwards, I will check whether I indeed make good eye contact""
}

If we analyse this learning objective as an example with the aforementioned criteria: we see that it is indeed SMART in its formulation:
Specifics: Making eye contact with the audience
Measurable: It is clear how this can be measured, as you can see in a video recording or ask the audience if eye contact is indeed made -> family or friends you can also ask for feedback!
Action-oriented: It is clear exactly what you are doing when the goal is achieved: ""looking well into the camera most of the time"", and ""alternating between looking at different people in the audience"".
Relevant: ""Making eye contact"" fits within the assessment criterion ""non-verbal communication"" and can be found on the inspiration list for key sub-skills in presentation [see assessment criteria].
Time-bound: ""during my video pitch and literature presentation""

And Analyzing the sample action plan we see it specifically indicates which steps are taken in preparation (""don't literally memorise"", ""make video recordings and check if people are looking into the camera"", and ""by asking feedback from group members after a live presentation""). The video recordings and feedback provide the right information on progress, allowing you to make adjustments.
=====

Now the student's draft follows:
=====
{
  ""smart"": ""By the end of the 4-week course, I aim to enhance my presentation skills by effectively using pitch and intonation to make my speech more engaging and understandable. This will be achieved by varying my pitch to emphasize key points and modulating my intonation to maintain audience interest throughout my presentations. My success will be measured by receiving positive feedback on my use of pitch and intonation from at least three peers and one instructor."",
  ""plan"": ""To accomplish this, I will begin by researching techniques for effective pitch and intonation control and incorporate these strategies into my daily speaking practice. I will collaborate with a study group to practice presentations and receive constructive feedback on my pitch and intonation. Additionally, I will record my practice sessions to self-evaluate and adjust my techniques as needed. Progress will be monitored through weekly reflection on feedback from my study group and adjustments will be made accordingly to ensure continuous improvement. By the end of the course, I aim to confidently use pitch and intonation to enhance my presentations, as evidenced by the targeted feedback.""

Measurable: It is clear what information you use to determine whether the learning objective has been achieved. This can be named both quantitatively and qualitatively; for example, ""X positive comments about ""Y"" from fellow students"".
Action-oriented: It is clear what behaviour you exhibit when you have achieved your goal.
Relevant: The learning objective is based on your own analysis and fits within the assessment criteria.
Time-bound: The learning objective specifically indicates when the goal is achieved and is realistic for a 4-week project.

Furthermore, an ""action plan"" for a SMART goal should:
* contain concrete actions you will carry out to achieve your goal.
* Include how you will collect information on your progress in the meantime, so that you know whether you are on the right track and can make any necessary adjustments in the meantime.
* Be clear and follow logically from the formulated learning objective  .
* Be achievable within the stipulated time.
* Allow for interim evaluation and adjustment.
=====

An example of a SMART goal and action plan follows:
=====
{
    ""smart"": ""Make eye contact with the audience during my video pitch and literature presentation to better engage the viewer with my story. In the video pitch, I do this by looking closely into the camera most of the time and in the literature presentation by alternately looking at the different people in the audience, both my fellow students and teachers."",
    ""plan: ""I will achieve this by not memorising my story verbatim, but rather by using keywords and by practising looking into the camera and making video recordings of this during the preparation of my pitch. I also practise my literature presentation dry where my group mates sit on opposite sides of the room. In the video recordings and feedback from my group mates afterwards, I will check whether I indeed make good eye contact""
}

If we analyse this learning objective as an example with the aforementioned criteria: we see that it is indeed SMART in its formulation:
Specifics: Making eye contact with the audience
Measurable: It is clear how this can be measured, as you can see in a video recording or ask the audience if eye contact is indeed made -> family or friends you can also ask for feedback!
Action-oriented: It is clear exactly what you are doing when the goal is achieved: ""looking well into the camera most of the time"", and ""alternating between looking at different people in the audience"".
Relevant: ""Making eye contact"" fits within the assessment criterion ""non-verbal communication"" and can be found on the inspiration list for key sub-skills in presentation [see assessment criteria].
Time-bound: ""during my video pitch and literature presentation""

And Analyzing the sample action plan we see it specifically indicates which steps are taken in preparation (""don't literally memorise"", ""make video recordings and check if people are looking into the camera"", and ""by asking feedback from group members after a live presentation""). The video recordings and feedback provide the right information on progress, allowing you to make adjustments.
=====

Now the student's draft follows:
=====
{
  ""smart"": ""To enhance my presentation skills by ensuring my voice volume is consistently loud and clear enough to be heard by everyone in the classroom, regardless of their seating position, during my 10-minute project presentation. This will be measured by receiving feedback from at least three peers sitting in different parts of the room and my teacher, aiming for positive comments on the audibility of my presentation."",
  ""plan"": ""I will start by recording myself delivering parts of my presentation, then listen to the playback to assess my volume and clarity, making notes on where improvements are needed. I will also research techniques for voice projection and practice these daily. Additionally, I plan to conduct at least two rehearsal presentations in front of friends or family members, asking them to sit at varying distances from me. I will kindly request their honest feedback on my voice volume and clarity, specifically asking them to recall any parts of the presentation that were difficult to hear. Based on this feedback, I will adjust my voice projection techniques accordingly. Progress will be tracked through a log where I note the feedback received and the adjustments made after each rehearsal. This plan is designed to be completed over the next four weeks, with interim evaluations scheduled at the end of each week to ensure I am on track to meet my goal.""

A SMART learning goal must be Specific, Measurable, Action-oriented, Relevant, and Time-bound as described further below:
Specific: Concrete and unambiguous definition of the goal: is it clear what you want to achieve?
Measurable: It is clear what information you use to determine whether the learning objective has been achieved. This can be named both quantitatively and qualitatively; for example, ""X positive comments about ""Y"" from fellow students"".
Action-oriented: It is clear what behaviour you exhibit when you have achieved your goal.
Relevant: The learning objective is based on your own analysis and fits within the assessment criteria.
Time-bound: The learning objective specifically indicates when the goal is achieved and is realistic for a 4-week project.

Furthermore, an ""action plan"" for a SMART goal should:
* contain concrete actions you will carry out to achieve your goal.
* Include how you will collect information on your progress in the meantime, so that you know whether you are on the right track and can make any necessary adjustments in the meantime.
* Be clear and follow logically from the formulated learning objective  .
* Be achievable within the stipulated time.
* Allow for interim evaluation and adjustment.
=====

An example of a SMART goal and action plan follows:
=====
{
    ""smart"": ""Make eye contact with the audience during my video pitch and literature presentation to better engage the viewer with my story. In the video pitch, I do this by looking closely into the camera most of the time and in the literature presentation by alternately looking at the different people in the audience, both my fellow students and teachers."",
    ""plan: ""I will achieve this by not memorising my story verbatim, but rather by using keywords and by practising looking into the camera and making video recordings of this during the preparation of my pitch. I also practise my literature presentation dry where my group mates sit on opposite sides of the room. In the video recordings and feedback from my group mates afterwards, I will check whether I indeed make good eye contact""
}

If we analyse this learning objective as an example with the aforementioned criteria: we see that it is indeed SMART in its formulation:
Specifics: Making eye contact with the audience
Measurable: It is clear how this can be measured, as you can see in a video recording or ask the audience if eye contact is indeed made -> family or friends you can also ask for feedback!
Action-oriented: It is clear exactly what you are doing when the goal is achieved: ""looking well into the camera most of the time"", and ""alternating between looking at different people in the audience"".
Relevant: ""Making eye contact"" fits within the assessment criterion ""non-verbal communication"" and can be found on the inspiration list for key sub-skills in presentation [see assessment criteria].
Time-bound: ""during my video pitch and literature presentation""

And Analyzing the sample action plan we see it specifically indicates which steps are taken in preparation (""don't literally memorise"", ""make video recordings and check if people are looking into the camera"", and ""by asking feedback from group members after a live presentation""). The video recordings and feedback provide the right information on progress, allowing you to make adjustments.
=====

Now the student's draft follows:
=====
{
  ""smart"": ""By the end of the 4-week course, I aim to enhance my non-verbal communication skills, specifically through the use of humor in presentations, to ensure at least three instances of laughter from the audience during my 10-minute final presentation. This will be measured by the audible laughter and positive feedback from both peers and instructors, demonstrating an understanding and effective use of humor to engage and connect with my audience."",
  ""plan"": ""To achieve this, I will begin by researching techniques for integrating humor effectively into presentations, focusing on timing, relevance, and audience understanding. I will draft my presentation early, incorporating at least five potential humorous elements or jokes, aligned with the presentation content. Each week, I will practice the presentation in front of a small audience of friends or family, noting which jokes elicit laughter and which fall flat, allowing for adjustments. Feedback will be actively sought after each practice session, specifically regarding the humor's delivery and reception. This iterative process of practice, feedback, and adjustment will continue until the final presentation, ensuring continuous improvement and alignment with the goal of engaging my audience through humor.""
}
=====

Now analyze/discuss the student's work in the context of how well it fits the assignment, discuss as your private reflection on their work. Then end your response with a json object containing your final evaluation to be seen by the student.
For scores, use a scale from 1 to 10 inclusive, where 1 is the worst and 10 is the best (do NOT use null), and for ""feedback"" be sure to adhere to the aforementioned feedback principles (don't discuss the score in the feedback as its private).
The json object MUST use double quotes for keys/values and should conform to this json schema:
{'$defs': {'FeedbackAttr': {'properties': {'score': {'default': None, 'maximum': 10, 'minimum': 1, 'title': 'Score in the range [1,10] inclusive.', 'type': 'integer'}, 'feedback': {'title': 'Feedback', 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['feedback'], 'title': 'FeedbackAttr', 'type': 'object'}}, 'properties': {'specific': {'$ref': '#/$defs/FeedbackAttr'}, 'measurable': {'$ref': '#/$defs/FeedbackAttr'}, 'action_oriented': {'$ref': '#/$defs/FeedbackAttr'}, 'relevant': {'$ref': '#/$defs/FeedbackAttr'}, 'time_bound': {'$ref': '#/$defs/FeedbackAttr'}, 'overall_feedback': {'title': 'Overall Feedback', 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['specific', 'measurable', 'action_oriented', 'relevant', 'time_bound', 'overall_feedback'], 'title': 'SMARTFeedback', 'type': 'object'}
","Overall, the student has demonstrated a good understanding of the assignment by creating a SMART goal and action plan that are specific, measurable, action-oriented, relevant, and time-bound. The goal to enhance non-verbal communication skills through the use of humor in presentations is clearly defined and achievable within the given timeframe.

Specific: The student has clearly outlined the specific goal of eliciting at least three instances of laughter from the audience during their final presentation through the use of humor.
Measurable: The student has provided a clear way to measure the goal by tracking audible laughter and seeking feedback from peers and instructors.
Action-oriented: The plan includes concrete actions such as researching techniques, practicing with friends and family, and seeking feedback for continuous improvement.
Relevant: The goal of using humor in presentations aligns well with the objective of engaging and connecting with the audience.
Time-bound: The goal is time-bound, set to be achieved by the end of the 4-week course.

In terms of improvements, the student could consider setting more specific criteria for what constitutes effective use of humor and how to make adjustments based on feedback. Additionally, they could include a plan for how they will ensure the humor is appropriate for the audience and the context of the presentation.

Overall, the student has shown a strong understanding of SMART goals and action plans, and with some additional refinement, their goal of enhancing non-verbal communication skills through humor in presentations is well on track. Keep up the good work!

* When praise is appropriate, direct it to effort, strategic behaviours, and learning goals. Avoid praising ability or intelligence.
* Provide action points when possible on how the student's work could be improved.
* If it seems the student misunderstands the assignments goals, criteria, or expected standards, clearly highlight the gap (and provide action points if appropriate).

The rubric for the assignment follows (delimited by =====):
=====
A SMART learning goal must be Specific, Measurable, Action-oriented, Relevant, and Time-bound as described further below:
Specific: Concrete and unambiguous definition of the goal: is it clear what you want to achieve?
Measurable: It is clear what information you use to determine whether the learning objective has been achieved. This can be named both quantitatively and qualitatively; for example, ""X positive comments about ""Y"" from fellow students"".
Action-oriented: It is clear what behaviour you exhibit when you have achieved your goal.
Relevant: The learning objective is based on your own analysis and fits within the assessment criteria.
Time-bound: The learning objective specifically indicates when the goal is achieved and is realistic for a 4-week project.

Furthermore, an ""action plan"" for a SMART goal should:
* contain concrete actions you will carry out to achieve your goal.
* Include how you will collect information on your progress in the meantime, so that you know whether you are on the right track and can make any necessary adjustments in the meantime.
* Be clear and follow logically from the formulated learning objective  .
* Be achievable within the stipulated time.
* Allow for interim evaluation and adjustment.
=====

An example of a SMART goal and action plan follows:
=====
{
    ""smart"": ""Make eye contact with the audience during my video pitch and literature presentation to better engage the viewer with my story. In the video pitch, I do this by looking closely into the camera most of the time and in the literature presentation by alternately looking at the different people in the audience, both my fellow students and teachers."",
    ""plan: ""I will achieve this by not memorising my story verbatim, but rather by using keywords and by practising looking into the camera and making video recordings of this during the preparation of my pitch. I also practise my literature presentation dry where my group mates sit on opposite sides of the room. In the video recordings and feedback from my group mates afterwards, I will check whether I indeed make good eye contact""
}

If we analyse this learning objective as an example with the aforementioned criteria: we see that it is indeed SMART in its formulation:
Specifics: Making eye contact with the audience
Measurable: It is clear how this can be measured, as you can see in a video recording or ask the audience if eye contact is indeed made -> family or friends you can also ask for feedback!
Action-oriented: It is clear exactly what you are doing when the goal is achieved: ""looking well into the camera most of the time"", and ""alternating between looking at different people in the audience"".
Relevant: ""Making eye contact"" fits within the assessment criterion ""non-verbal communication"" and can be found on the inspiration list for key sub-skills in presentation [see assessment criteria].
Time-bound: ""during my video pitch and literature presentation""

And Analyzing the sample action plan we see it specifically indicates which steps are taken in preparation (""don't literally memorise"", ""make video recordings and check if people are looking into the camera"", and ""by asking feedback from group members after a live presentation""). The video recordings and feedback provide the right information on progress, allowing you to make adjustments.

Now the student's draft follows:
=====
{
  ""smart"": ""Master the art of using hand gestures to emphasize my spoken words during presentations, because apparently, flailing my arms with purpose can magically transform me into a more engaging speaker. Specifically, I will use hand gestures to count out main points, and to visually differentiate between contrasting ideas, making my presentations not just a feast for the ears but a circus for the eyes as well."",
  ""plan"": ""To achieve this spectacle, I will undergo a rigorous training regime, starting with watching an excessive number of TED Talks to analyze the hand gesture sorcery of seasoned speakers. Following this, I'll practice in front of a mirror, counting imaginary points and weighing invisible options in my hands, to ensure my gestures don't come off as an attempt to swat invisible flies. I'll record these sessions, because nothing screams progress like watching yourself trying to mime your way through complex topics. Feedback will be solicited from friends and family, who I'm sure will relish the opportunity to critique my newfound gesturing prowess. This cycle of watch, practice, record, and feedback will continue until I can confidently say my hand gestures add, rather than detract, from my presentations, all within the laughably short span of four weeks.""

Your feedback must adhere to the following principles:
* Feedback shall be geared to providing information about progress and achievement, not towards providing a summative grade or pass/fail assessment.
* When praise is appropriate, direct it to effort, strategic behaviours, and learning goals. Avoid praising ability or intelligence.
* Provide action points when possible on how the student's work could be improved.
* If it seems the student misunderstands the assignments goals, criteria, or expected standards, clearly highlight the gap (and provide action points if appropriate).

The rubric for the assignment follows (delimited by =====):
=====
A SMART learning goal must be Specific, Measurable, Action-oriented, Relevant, and Time-bound as described further below:
Specific: Concrete and unambiguous definition of the goal: is it clear what you want to achieve?
Measurable: It is clear what information you use to determine whether the learning objective has been achieved. This can be named both quantitatively and qualitatively; for example, ""X positive comments about ""Y"" from fellow students"".
Action-oriented: It is clear what behaviour you exhibit when you have achieved your goal.
Relevant: The learning objective is based on your own analysis and fits within the assessment criteria.
Time-bound: The learning objective specifically indicates when the goal is achieved and is realistic for a 4-week project.

Furthermore, an ""action plan"" for a SMART goal should:
* contain concrete actions you will carry out to achieve your goal.
* Include how you will collect information on your progress in the meantime, so that you know whether you are on the right track and can make any necessary adjustments in the meantime.
* Be clear and follow logically from the formulated learning objective  .
* Be achievable within the stipulated time.
* Allow for interim evaluation and adjustment.
=====

An example of a SMART goal and action plan follows:
=====
{
    ""smart"": ""Make eye contact with the audience during my video pitch and literature presentation to better engage the viewer with my story. In the video pitch, I do this by looking closely into the camera most of the time and in the literature presentation by alternately looking at the different people in the audience, both my fellow students and teachers."",
    ""plan: ""I will achieve this by not memorising my story verbatim, but rather by using keywords and by practising looking into the camera and making video recordings of this during the preparation of my pitch. I also practise my literature presentation dry where my group mates sit on opposite sides of the room. In the video recordings and feedback from my group mates afterwards, I will check whether I indeed make good eye contact""
}

If we analyse this learning objective as an example with the aforementioned criteria: we see that it is indeed SMART in its formulation:
Specifics: Making eye contact with the audience
Measurable: It is clear how this can be measured, as you can see in a video recording or ask the audience if eye contact is indeed made -> family or friends you can also ask for feedback!
Action-oriented: It is clear exactly what you are doing when the goal is achieved: ""looking well into the camera most of the time"", and ""alternating between looking at different people in the audience"".
Relevant: ""Making eye contact"" fits within the assessment criterion ""non-verbal communication"" and can be found on the inspiration list for key sub-skills in presentation [see assessment criteria].
Time-bound: ""during my video pitch and literature presentation""

And Analyzing the sample action plan we see it specifically indicates which steps are taken in preparation (""don't literally memorise"", ""make video recordings and check if people are looking into the camera"", and ""by asking feedback from group members after a live presentation""). The video recordings and feedback provide the right information on progress, allowing you to make adjustments.
=====

Now the student's draft follows:
=====
{
  ""smart"": ""Utilize hand gestures during my presentations to underscore my points, because apparently, flailing my arms with purpose can magically make my arguments more convincing. In each presentation, I aim to consciously employ hand gestures, such as counting with my fingers when listing items or using open palms to signify honesty and engagement, to support at least three key points I make."",
  ""plan"": ""To achieve this lofty goal of becoming a hand gesture maestro, I will start by watching TED Talks, noting every time a speaker uses a gesture that seems to elevate their speech from mundane to slightly less mundane. I'll practice these gestures in front of a mirror, critiquing myself with the enthusiasm of someone who truly believes this will make a difference. Following this, I'll inflict my practice presentations on friends and family, asking for feedback specifically on my hand gestures - because, of course, they have nothing better to do. I'll keep a log of their comments, ranging from 'that looked natural' to 'why are you doing jazz hands?' to measure my progress. This feedback will serve as the basis for adjusting my gestures to find that sweet spot between 'enthusiastic' and 'about to take flight.' According to the grand theory of hand gestures enhancing communication, by the end of four weeks, I should be able to not only talk the talk but also wave the wave.""
}
=====

Now analyze/discuss the student's work in the context of how well it fits the assignment, discuss as your private reflection on their work. Then end your response with a json object containing your final evaluation to be seen by the student.
For scores, use a scale from 1 to 10 inclusive, where 1 is the worst and 10 is the best (do NOT use null), and for ""feedback"" be sure to adhere to the aforementioned feedback principles (don't discuss the score in the feedback as its private).
The json object MUST use double quotes for keys/values and should conform to this json schema:
{'$defs': {'FeedbackAttr': {'properties': {'score': {'default': None, 'maximum': 10, 'minimum': 1, 'title': 'Score in the range [1,10] inclusive.', 'type': 'integer'}, 'feedback': {'title': 'Feedback', 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['feedback'], 'title': 'FeedbackAttr', 'type': 'object'}}, 'properties': {'specific': {'$ref': '#/$defs/FeedbackAttr'}, 'measurable': {'$ref': '#/$defs/FeedbackAttr'}, 'action_oriented': {'$ref': '#/$defs/FeedbackAttr'}, 'relevant': {'$ref': '#/$defs/FeedbackAttr'}, 'time_bound': {'$ref': '#/$defs/FeedbackAttr'}, 'overall_feedback': {'title': 'Overall Feedback', 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['specific', 'measurable', 'action_oriented', 'relevant', 'time_bound', 'overall_feedback'], 'title': 'SMARTFeedback', 'type': 'object'}
","In analyzing the student's work, it is clear that they have made a good attempt at formulating a SMART goal and corresponding action plan. The specific goal of utilizing hand gestures during presentations to underscore key points is well-defined. The student has also included measurable aspects by aiming to support at least three key points with specific gestures and keeping a log of feedback from friends and family. The action-oriented approach of watching TED Talks, practicing gestures, and seeking feedback shows a clear plan of action. 

However, there are some areas for improvement. Firstly, the relevance of hand gestures in enhancing communication could be further emphasized by relating it to specific assessment criteria or learning objectives. Additionally, the time-bound aspect could be strengthened by setting more specific timelines or milestones within the 4-week project period to track progress more effectively.

Overall, the student has shown effort and creativity in formulating their SMART goal and action plan, but there is room for refinement in ensuring alignment with the assignment criteria and enhancing the time-bound aspect.

You are a peer reviewer, tasked with giving a student feedback about an assignment.
Your feedback must adhere to the following principles:
* Feedback shall be geared to providing information about progress and achievement, not towards providing a summative grade or pass/fail assessment.
* When praise is appropriate, direct it to effort, strategic behaviours, and learning goals. Avoid praising ability or intelligence.
* Provide action points when possible on how the student's work could be improved.
* If it seems the student misunderstands the assignments goals, criteria, or expected standards, clearly highlight the gap (and provide action points if appropriate).

The rubric for the assignment follows (delimited by =====):
=====
A SMART learning goal must be Specific, Measurable, Action-oriented, Relevant, and Time-bound as described further below:
Specific: Concrete and unambiguous definition of the goal: is it clear what you want to achieve?
Measurable: It is clear what information you use to determine whether the learning objective has been achieved. This can be named both quantitatively and qualitatively; for example, ""X positive comments about ""Y"" from fellow students"".
Action-oriented: It is clear what behaviour you exhibit when you have achieved your goal.
Relevant: The learning objective is based on your own analysis and fits within the assessment criteria.
Time-bound: The learning objective specifically indicates when the goal is achieved and is realistic for a 4-week project.

Furthermore, an ""action plan"" for a SMART goal should:
* contain concrete actions you will carry out to achieve your goal.
* Include how you will collect information on your progress in the meantime, so that you know whether you are on the right track and can make any necessary adjustments in the meantime.
* Be clear and follow logically from the formulated learning objective  .
* Be achievable within the stipulated time.
* Allow for interim evaluation and adjustment.
=====

An example of a SMART goal and action plan follows:
=====
{
    ""smart"": ""Make eye contact with the audience during my video pitch and literature presentation to better engage the viewer with my story. In the video pitch, I do this by looking closely into the camera most of the time and in the literature presentation by alternately looking at the different people in the audience, both my fellow students and teachers."",
    ""plan: ""I will achieve this by not memorising my story verbatim, but rather by using keywords and by practising looking into the camera and making video recordings of this during the preparation of my pitch. I also practise my literature presentation dry where my group mates sit on opposite sides of the room. In the video recordings and feedback from my group mates afterwards, I will check whether I indeed make good eye contact""
}

If we analyse this learning objective as an example with the aforementioned criteria: we see that it is indeed SMART in its formulation:
Specifics: Making eye contact with the audience
Measurable: It is clear how this can be measured, as you can see in a video recording or ask the audience if eye contact is indeed made -> family or friends you can also ask for feedback!
Action-oriented: It is clear exactly what you are doing when the goal is achieved: ""looking well into the camera most of the time"", and ""alternating between looking at different people in the audience"".
Relevant: ""Making eye contact"" fits within the assessment criterion ""non-verbal communication"" and can be found on the inspiration list for key sub-skills in presentation [see assessment criteria].
Time-bound: ""during my video pitch and literature presentation""

And Analyzing the sample action plan we see it specifically indicates which steps are taken in preparation (""don't literally memorise"", ""make video recordings and check if people are looking into the camera"", and ""by asking feedback from group members after a live presentation""). The video recordings and feedback provide the right information on progress, allowing you to make adjustments.
=====

Now the student's draft follows:
=====
{
  ""smart"": ""Enhance my ability to structure presentations logically and coherently, ensuring each has a clear introduction, middle, and conclusion, with seamless transitions between sections. This skill will be demonstrated in my upcoming class project presentation, aiming for a positive acknowledgment from at least three peers and one instructor on the organization of my content."",
  ""plan"": ""To achieve this, I will begin by studying examples of well-structured presentations in my field, noting the patterns and techniques used for effective transitions and organization. I will draft an outline for my presentation, then seek feedback from a study group to refine it. I will practice my presentation multiple times, focusing on the flow from one section to the next. Progress will be measured by recording these practice sessions and reviewing them for coherence and logical flow, as well as by soliciting ongoing feedback from my study group and making adjustments as needed.""
}
=====

Now analyze/discuss the student's work in the context of how well it fits the assignment, discuss as your private reflection on their work. Then end your response with a json object containing your final evaluation to be seen by the student.
For scores, use a scale from 1 to 10 inclusive, where 1 is the worst and 10 is the best (do NOT use null), and for ""feedback"" be sure to adhere to the aforementioned feedback principles (don't discuss the score in the feedback as its private).
The json object MUST use double quotes for keys/values and should conform to this json schema:
{'$defs': {'FeedbackAttr': {'properties': {'score': {'default': None, 'maximum': 10, 'minimum': 1, 'title': 'Score in the range [1,10] inclusive.', 'type': 'integer'}, 'feedback': {'title': 'Feedback', 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['feedback'], 'title': 'FeedbackAttr', 'type': 'object'}}, 'properties': {'specific': {'$ref': '#/$defs/FeedbackAttr'}, 'measurable': {'$ref': '#/$defs/FeedbackAttr'}, 'action_oriented': {'$ref': '#/$defs/FeedbackAttr'}, 'relevant': {'$ref': '#/$defs/FeedbackAttr'}, 'time_bound': {'$ref': '#/$defs/FeedbackAttr'}, 'overall_feedback': {'title': 'Overall Feedback', 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['specific', 'measurable', 'action_oriented', 'relevant', 'time_bound', 'overall_feedback'], 'title': 'SMARTFeedback', 'type': 'object'}
","In analyzing the student's work, they have articulated a SMART learning goal that is specific, measurable, action-oriented, relevant, and time-bound. The goal to enhance presentation structure with clear sections and transitions is well-defined and focused. The plan to study examples, seek feedback, and practice presentations is a solid strategy for achieving the goal. The student has also included measures for progress such as recording practice sessions and ongoing feedback.

One area for improvement could be to make the goal even more specific by detailing what constitutes a ""positive acknowledgment"" from peers and instructors. Clarifying this aspect would provide a clearer target for the student to aim for. Additionally, considering incorporating self-reflection into the action plan to encourage continuous improvement based on personal insights.

Overall, the student's work shows a good understanding of SMART goals and action plans, and with some minor adjustments, they can further enhance the effectiveness of their goal-setting process.

You are a peer reviewer, tasked with giving a student feedback about an assignment.
Your feedback must adhere to the following principles:
* Feedback shall be geared to providing information about progress and achievement, not towards providing a summative grade or pass/fail assessment.
* When praise is appropriate, direct it to effort, strategic behaviours, and learning goals. Avoid praising ability or intelligence.
* Provide action points when possible on how the student's work could be improved.
* If it seems the student misunderstands the assignments goals, criteria, or expected standards, clearly highlight the gap (and provide action points if appropriate).

The rubric for the assignment follows (delimited by =====):
=====
A SMART learning goal must be Specific, Measurable, Action-oriented, Relevant, and Time-bound as described further below:
Specific: Concrete and unambiguous definition of the goal: is it clear what you want to achieve?
Measurable: It is clear what information you use to determine whether the learning objective has been achieved. This can be named both quantitatively and qualitatively; for example, ""X positive comments about ""Y"" from fellow students"".
Action-oriented: It is clear what behaviour you exhibit when you have achieved your goal.
Relevant: The learning objective is based on your own analysis and fits within the assessment criteria.
Time-bound: The learning objective specifically indicates when the goal is achieved and is realistic for a 4-week project.

Furthermore, an ""action plan"" for a SMART goal should:
* contain concrete actions you will carry out to achieve your goal.
* Include how you will collect information on your progress in the meantime, so that you know whether you are on the right track and can make any necessary adjustments in the meantime.
* Be clear and follow logically from the formulated learning objective  .
* Be achievable within the stipulated time.
* Allow for interim evaluation and adjustment.
=====

An example of a SMART goal and action plan follows:
=====
{
    ""smart"": ""Make eye contact with the audience during my video pitch and literature presentation to better engage the viewer with my story. In the video pitch, I do this by looking closely into the camera most of the time and in the literature presentation by alternately looking at the different people in the audience, both my fellow students and teachers."",
    ""plan: ""I will achieve this by not memorising my story verbatim, but rather by using keywords and by practising looking into the camera and making video recordings of this during the preparation of my pitch. I also practise my literature presentation dry where my group mates sit on opposite sides of the room. In the video recordings and feedback from my group mates afterwards, I will check whether I indeed make good eye contact""
}

If we analyse this learning objective as an example with the aforementioned criteria: we see that it is indeed SMART in its formulation:
Specifics: Making eye contact with the audience
Measurable: It is clear how this can be measured, as you can see in a video recording or ask the audience if eye contact is indeed made -> family or friends you can also ask for feedback!
Action-oriented: It is clear exactly what you are doing when the goal is achieved: ""looking well into the camera most of the time"", and ""alternating between looking at different people in the audience"".
Relevant: ""Making eye contact"" fits within the assessment criterion ""non-verbal communication"" and can be found on the inspiration list for key sub-skills in presentation [see assessment criteria].
Time-bound: ""during my video pitch and literature presentation""

And Analyzing the sample action plan we see it specifically indicates which steps are taken in preparation (""don't literally memorise"", ""make video recordings and check if people are looking into the camera"", and ""by asking feedback from group members after a live presentation""). The video recordings and feedback provide the right information on progress, allowing you to make adjustments.
=====

Now the student's draft follows:
=====
{
  ""smart"": ""Improve my voice volume during presentations to ensure that my speech is audible to all attendees, integrating relevant theory to enhance understanding and engagement."",
  ""plan"": ""To achieve this goal, I will begin by researching vocal projection techniques and the theory behind effective public speaking. I will then incorporate these techniques into my daily practice sessions, focusing on exercises that strengthen my voice and improve clarity. Additionally, I will seek feedback from peers and instructors on my volume and clarity during practice presentations. I plan to record these sessions to self-assess and adjust my techniques as needed. However, the plan does not specify when the goal will be achieved or the specific actions to be taken during the learning process.""
}
=====

Now analyze/discuss the student's work in the context of how well it fits the assignment, discuss as your private reflection on their work. Then end your response with a json object containing your final evaluation to be seen by the student.
For scores, use a scale from 1 to 10 inclusive, where 1 is the worst and 10 is the best (do NOT use null), and for ""feedback"" be sure to adhere to the aforementioned feedback principles (don't discuss the score in the feedback as its private).
The json object MUST use double quotes for keys/values and should conform to this json schema:
{'$defs': {'FeedbackAttr': {'properties': {'score': {'default': None, 'maximum': 10, 'minimum': 1, 'title': 'Score in the range [1,10] inclusive.', 'type': 'integer'}, 'feedback': {'title': 'Feedback', 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['feedback'], 'title': 'FeedbackAttr', 'type': 'object'}}, 'properties': {'specific': {'$ref': '#/$defs/FeedbackAttr'}, 'measurable': {'$ref': '#/$defs/FeedbackAttr'}, 'action_oriented': {'$ref': '#/$defs/FeedbackAttr'}, 'relevant': {'$ref': '#/$defs/FeedbackAttr'}, 'time_bound': {'$ref': '#/$defs/FeedbackAttr'}, 'overall_feedback': {'title': 'Overall Feedback', 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['specific', 'measurable', 'action_oriented', 'relevant', 'time_bound', 'overall_feedback'], 'title': 'SMARTFeedback', 'type': 'object'}
","In analyzing the student's work, it's evident that the SMART goal is mostly well-defined. The specific goal of improving voice volume during presentations is clear and focused. The plan outlined by the student is detailed and shows a good understanding of the actions needed to achieve the goal, such as researching techniques, incorporating them into practice sessions, seeking feedback, and self-assessment.

However, the student's action plan falls short in two areas. Firstly, the time-bound aspect is missing. It's essential to specify a deadline or timeframe within which the goal should be achieved to make it truly time-bound. Additionally, the plan could benefit from more specific actions detailing how the student will implement the vocal projection techniques and theory into their daily practice sessions.

To improve the work further, the student should consider adding a clear deadline for when the goal should be achieved and refining the plan by specifying the exact exercises and techniques they will use to strengthen their voice and improve clarity.

Overall, the student has shown a good grasp of creating a SMART goal and action plan but would benefit from further refinement in terms of specificity and time-bound elements.

You are a peer reviewer, tasked with giving a student feedback about an assignment.
Your feedback must adhere to the following principles:
* Feedback shall be geared to providing information about progress and achievement, not towards providing a summative grade or pass/fail assessment.
* When praise is appropriate, direct it to effort, strategic behaviours, and learning goals. Avoid praising ability or intelligence.
* Provide action points when possible on how the student's work could be improved.
* If it seems the student misunderstands the assignments goals, criteria, or expected standards, clearly highlight the gap (and provide action points if appropriate).

The rubric for the assignment follows (delimited by =====):
=====
A SMART learning goal must be Specific, Measurable, Action-oriented, Relevant, and Time-bound as described further below:
Specific: Concrete and unambiguous definition of the goal: is it clear what you want to achieve?
Measurable: It is clear what information you use to determine whether the learning objective has been achieved. This can be named both quantitatively and qualitatively; for example, ""X positive comments about ""Y"" from fellow students"".
Action-oriented: It is clear what behaviour you exhibit when you have achieved your goal.
Relevant: The learning objective is based on your own analysis and fits within the assessment criteria.
Time-bound: The learning objective specifically indicates when the goal is achieved and is realistic for a 4-week project.

Furthermore, an ""action plan"" for a SMART goal should:
* contain concrete actions you will carry out to achieve your goal.
* Include how you will collect information on your progress in the meantime, so that you know whether you are on the right track and can make any necessary adjustments in the meantime.
* Be clear and follow logically from the formulated learning objective  .
* Be achievable within the stipulated time.
* Allow for interim evaluation and adjustment.
=====

An example of a SMART goal and action plan follows:
=====
{
    ""smart"": ""Make eye contact with the audience during my video pitch and literature presentation to better engage the viewer with my story. In the video pitch, I do this by looking closely into the camera most of the time and in the literature presentation by alternately looking at the different people in the audience, both my fellow students and teachers."",
    ""plan: ""I will achieve this by not memorising my story verbatim, but rather by using keywords and by practising looking into the camera and making video recordings of this during the preparation of my pitch. I also practise my literature presentation dry where my group mates sit on opposite sides of the room. In the video recordings and feedback from my group mates afterwards, I will check whether I indeed make good eye contact""
}

If we analyse this learning objective as an example with the aforementioned criteria: we see that it is indeed SMART in its formulation:
Specifics: Making eye contact with the audience
Measurable: It is clear how this can be measured, as you can see in a video recording or ask the audience if eye contact is indeed made -> family or friends you can also ask for feedback!
Action-oriented: It is clear exactly what you are doing when the goal is achieved: ""looking well into the camera most of the time"", and ""alternating between looking at different people in the audience"".
Relevant: ""Making eye contact"" fits within the assessment criterion ""non-verbal communication"" and can be found on the inspiration list for key sub-skills in presentation [see assessment criteria].
Time-bound: ""during my video pitch and literature presentation""

And Analyzing the sample action plan we see it specifically indicates which steps are taken in preparation (""don't literally memorise"", ""make video recordings and check if people are looking into the camera"", and ""by asking feedback from group members after a live presentation""). The video recordings and feedback provide the right information on progress, allowing you to make adjustments.

  ""smart"": ""Improve my ability to use facial expressions effectively during presentations to make my delivery more engaging and to better emphasize key points. This includes practicing a friendly smile to appear more accessible and using varied expressions to highlight different aspects of my content."",
  ""plan"": ""To enhance my facial expressions, I'll start by watching videos of effective communicators and noting how they use their facial expressions to complement their verbal messages. I'll practice in front of a mirror, focusing on matching my expressions with the tone and content of what I'm saying. Additionally, I'll record myself delivering parts of my presentation to review how my expressions come across on camera. Seeking feedback from friends and family on these recordings will also be a part of my strategy. Their insights will be crucial for understanding how my expressions are perceived and what improvements can be made. Lastly, maintaining a high level of motivation throughout this process is key, as it will drive me to consistently seek opportunities to refine and apply what I've learned.""

You are a peer reviewer, tasked with giving a student feedback about an assignment.
Your feedback must adhere to the following principles:
* Feedback shall be geared to providing information about progress and achievement, not towards providing a summative grade or pass/fail assessment.
* When praise is appropriate, direct it to effort, strategic behaviours, and learning goals. Avoid praising ability or intelligence.
* Provide action points when possible on how the student's work could be improved.
* If it seems the student misunderstands the assignments goals, criteria, or expected standards, clearly highlight the gap (and provide action points if appropriate).

The rubric for the assignment follows (delimited by =====):
=====
A SMART learning goal must be Specific, Measurable, Action-oriented, Relevant, and Time-bound as described further below:
Specific: Concrete and unambiguous definition of the goal: is it clear what you want to achieve?
Measurable: It is clear what information you use to determine whether the learning objective has been achieved. This can be named both quantitatively and qualitatively; for example, ""X positive comments about ""Y"" from fellow students"".
Action-oriented: It is clear what behaviour you exhibit when you have achieved your goal.
Relevant: The learning objective is based on your own analysis and fits within the assessment criteria.
Time-bound: The learning objective specifically indicates when the goal is achieved and is realistic for a 4-week project.

Furthermore, an ""action plan"" for a SMART goal should:
* contain concrete actions you will carry out to achieve your goal.
* Include how you will collect information on your progress in the meantime, so that you know whether you are on the right track and can make any necessary adjustments in the meantime.
* Be clear and follow logically from the formulated learning objective  .
* Be achievable within the stipulated time.
* Allow for interim evaluation and adjustment.
=====

An example of a SMART goal and action plan follows:
=====
{
    ""smart"": ""Make eye contact with the audience during my video pitch and literature presentation to better engage the viewer with my story. In the video pitch, I do this by looking closely into the camera most of the time and in the literature presentation by alternately looking at the different people in the audience, both my fellow students and teachers."",
    ""plan: ""I will achieve this by not memorising my story verbatim, but rather by using keywords and by practising looking into the camera and making video recordings of this during the preparation of my pitch. I also practise my literature presentation dry where my group mates sit on opposite sides of the room. In the video recordings and feedback from my group mates afterwards, I will check whether I indeed make good eye contact""
}

If we analyse this learning objective as an example with the aforementioned criteria: we see that it is indeed SMART in its formulation:
Specifics: Making eye contact with the audience
Measurable: It is clear how this can be measured, as you can see in a video recording or ask the audience if eye contact is indeed made -> family or friends you can also ask for feedback!
Action-oriented: It is clear exactly what you are doing when the goal is achieved: ""looking well into the camera most of the time"", and ""alternating between looking at different people in the audience"".
Relevant: ""Making eye contact"" fits within the assessment criterion ""non-verbal communication"" and can be found on the inspiration list for key sub-skills in presentation [see assessment criteria].
Time-bound: ""during my video pitch and literature presentation""

And Analyzing the sample action plan we see it specifically indicates which steps are taken in preparation (""don't literally memorise"", ""make video recordings and check if people are looking into the camera"", and ""by asking feedback from group members after a live presentation""). The video recordings and feedback provide the right information on progress, allowing you to make adjustments.

  ""smart"": ""By the end of the 4-week course, I aim to enhance my presentation skills by incorporating varied pitches and intonations, making my delivery more engaging and dynamic. This will be demonstrated during my final project presentation, where I'll use creativity to weave different pitches and intonations throughout my speech to highlight key points and maintain audience interest."",
  ""plan"": ""To achieve this, I'll begin by researching and watching videos of effective speakers to understand how they use pitch and intonation for impact. I'll then practice by recording myself delivering parts of my presentation, focusing on altering my pitch and intonation to emphasize different sections. I'll seek feedback from friends and family on these recordings, specifically asking if the changes in pitch and intonation made the presentation more engaging and easier to follow. Based on their feedback, I'll make adjustments to improve. Additionally, I'll dedicate time each day to practice speaking with varied pitches and intonations, even in casual conversations, to make this skill more natural for me. I'll keep a log of my practice sessions and the feedback received to track my progress and make necessary adjustments along the way.""

","Upon reviewing your draft, it is evident that you have created a SMART goal that is specific, measurable, action-oriented, relevant, and time-bound. Your goal of enhancing presentation skills through varied pitches and intonations is clear and well-defined. The plan you have outlined to achieve this goal by researching effective speakers, recording and practicing different intonations, seeking feedback, and regularly practicing is comprehensive and demonstrates a strong commitment to improvement.

One suggestion for improvement would be to consider incorporating specific metrics for measuring the effectiveness of your varied pitches and intonations. For example, you could set targets for the number of positive feedback responses from your friends and family regarding the impact of your delivery style. This would provide a clear indicator of progress and success towards your goal.

Overall, your approach to enhancing presentation skills is well-thought-out and focused. By following through with your action plan and making adjustments based on feedback received, you are on track to achieve significant improvement in your presentation skills.

Action-oriented:
The student's plan outlines clear actions such as watching videos of effective speakers, practicing in front of a mirror, and recording practice sessions for feedback. These actions directly contribute to achieving the goal of enhancing presentation skills through non-verbal communication.

Relevant:
The goal of improving presentation skills through non-verbal communication aligns with the assessment criteria and is relevant to the overall objective of the assignment. The chosen focus on gestures and facial expressions is a key aspect of effective communication.

Time-bound:
One area where the goal falls short is in establishing a clear timeline for when this improvement in presentation skills should be demonstrated. Setting a specific timeframe for achieving this goal would enhance the effectiveness of the SMART objective.

Overall, the student has demonstrated a good understanding of creating a SMART goal and action plan. To further improve, it is recommended to clarify the timing of when the enhanced presentation skills will be showcased and to define specific metrics for measuring progress towards the goal.

Additionally, consider linking your goal more directly to the assessment criteria or learning outcomes to ensure its relevance.

In your action plan, be sure to include clear actions and indicators of progress that directly align with your SMART goal. Also, consider setting more specific timelines for each step in your plan to ensure it is time-bound and achievable within the project's duration.

Overall, your initiative in setting a SMART goal and action plan is commendable, and with some refinements, you can further enhance the effectiveness of your approach to improving your presentation skills.

You are a peer reviewer, tasked with giving a student feedback about an assignment.
Your feedback must adhere to the following principles:
* Feedback shall be geared to providing information about progress and achievement, not towards providing a summative grade or pass/fail assessment.
* When praise is appropriate, direct it to effort, strategic behaviours, and learning goals. Avoid praising ability or intelligence.
* Provide action points when possible on how the student's work could be improved.
* If it seems the student misunderstands the assignments goals, criteria, or expected standards, clearly highlight the gap (and provide action points if appropriate).

The rubric for the assignment follows (delimited by =====):
=====
A SMART learning goal must be Specific, Measurable, Action-oriented, Relevant, and Time-bound as described further below:
Specific: Concrete and unambiguous definition of the goal: is it clear what you want to achieve?
Measurable: It is clear what information you use to determine whether the learning objective has been achieved. This can be named both quantitatively and qualitatively; for example, ""X positive comments about ""Y"" from fellow students"".
Action-oriented: It is clear what behaviour you exhibit when you have achieved your goal.
Relevant: The learning objective is based on your own analysis and fits within the assessment criteria.
Time-bound: The learning objective specifically indicates when the goal is achieved and is realistic for a 4-week project.

Furthermore, an ""action plan"" for a SMART goal should:
* contain concrete actions you will carry out to achieve your goal.
* Include how you will collect information on your progress in the meantime, so that you know whether you are on the right track and can make any necessary adjustments in the meantime.
* Be clear and follow logically from the formulated learning objective  .
* Be achievable within the stipulated time.
* Allow for interim evaluation and adjustment.
=====

An example of a SMART goal and action plan follows:
=====
{
    ""smart"": ""Make eye contact with the audience during my video pitch and literature presentation to better engage the viewer with my story. In the video pitch, I do this by looking closely into the camera most of the time and in the literature presentation by alternately looking at the different people in the audience, both my fellow students and teachers."",
    ""plan: ""I will achieve this by not memorising my story verbatim, but rather by using keywords and by practising looking into the camera and making video recordings of this during the preparation of my pitch. I also practise my literature presentation dry where my group mates sit on opposite sides of the room. In the video recordings and feedback from my group mates afterwards, I will check whether I indeed make good eye contact""
}

If we analyse this learning objective as an example with the aforementioned criteria: we see that it is indeed SMART in its formulation:
Specifics: Making eye contact with the audience
Measurable: It is clear how this can be measured, as you can see in a video recording or ask the audience if eye contact is indeed made -> family or friends you can also ask for feedback!
Action-oriented: It is clear exactly what you are doing when the goal is achieved: ""looking well into the camera most of the time"", and ""alternating between looking at different people in the audience"".
Relevant: ""Making eye contact"" fits within the assessment criterion ""non-verbal communication"" and can be found on the inspiration list for key sub-skills in presentation [see assessment criteria].
Time-bound: ""during my video pitch and literature presentation""

And Analyzing the sample action plan we see it specifically indicates which steps are taken in preparation (""don't literally memorise"", ""make video recordings and check if people are looking into the camera"", and ""by asking feedback from group members after a live presentation""). The video recordings and feedback provide the right information on progress, allowing you to make adjustments.

I'll practice my presentations, focusing on varying my pitch and intonation to highlight key points, aiming for a conversational tone that keeps the audience engaged. Recording these practice sessions will allow me to self-evaluate and adjust as needed. Additionally, I'll seek feedback from friends and family, asking them specifically about the effectiveness of my pitch and intonation in conveying my message and keeping their attention. This feedback will guide further adjustments to my technique.""

You are a peer reviewer, tasked with giving a student feedback about an assignment.
Your feedback must adhere to the following principles:
* Feedback shall be geared to providing information about progress and achievement, not towards providing a summative grade or pass/fail assessment.
* When praise is appropriate, direct it to effort, strategic behaviours, and learning goals. Avoid praising ability or intelligence.
* Provide action points when possible on how the student's work could be improved.
* If it seems the student misunderstands the assignments goals, criteria, or expected standards, clearly highlight the gap (and provide action points if appropriate).

The rubric for the assignment follows (delimited by =====):
=====
A SMART learning goal must be Specific, Measurable, Action-oriented, Relevant, and Time-bound as described further below:
Specific: Concrete and unambiguous definition of the goal: is it clear what you want to achieve?
Measurable: It is clear what information you use to determine whether the learning objective has been achieved. This can be named both quantitatively and qualitatively; for example, ""X positive comments about ""Y"" from fellow students"".
Action-oriented: It is clear what behaviour you exhibit when you have achieved your goal.
Relevant: The learning objective is based on your own analysis and fits within the assessment criteria.
Time-bound: The learning objective specifically indicates when the goal is achieved and is realistic for a 4-week project.

Furthermore, an ""action plan"" for a SMART goal should:
* contain concrete actions you will carry out to achieve your goal.
* Include how you will collect information on your progress in the meantime, so that you know whether you are on the right track and can make any necessary adjustments in the meantime.
* Be clear and follow logically from the formulated learning objective  .
* Be achievable within the stipulated time.
* Allow for interim evaluation and adjustment.
=====

An example of a SMART goal and action plan follows:
=====
{
    ""smart"": ""Make eye contact with the audience during my video pitch and literature presentation to better engage the viewer with my story. In the video pitch, I do this by looking closely into the camera most of the time and in the literature presentation by alternately looking at the different people in the audience, both my fellow students and teachers."",
    ""plan: ""I will achieve this by not memorising my story verbatim, but rather by using keywords and by practising looking into the camera and making video recordings of this during the preparation of my pitch. I also practise my literature presentation dry where my group mates sit on opposite sides of the room. In the video recordings and feedback from my group mates afterwards, I will check whether I indeed make good eye contact""
}

If we analyse this learning objective as an example with the aforementioned criteria: we see that it is indeed SMART in its formulation:
Specifics: Making eye contact with the audience
Measurable: It is clear how this can be measured, as you can see in a video recording or ask the audience if eye contact is indeed made -> family or friends you can also ask for feedback!
Action-oriented: It is clear exactly what you are doing when the goal is achieved: ""looking well into the camera most of the time"", and ""alternating between looking at different people in the audience"".
Relevant: ""Making eye contact"" fits within the assessment criterion ""non-verbal communication"" and can be found on the inspiration list for key sub-skills in presentation [see assessment criteria].
Time-bound: ""during my video pitch and literature presentation""

And Analyzing the sample action plan we see it specifically indicates which steps are taken in preparation (""don't literally memorise"", ""make video recordings and check if people are looking into the camera"", and ""by asking feedback from group members after a live presentation""). The video recordings and feedback provide the right information on progress, allowing you to make adjustments.

  ""plan"": ""To enhance my communication skills, I will begin by identifying and studying materials on effective communication strategies, focusing on simplifying complex ideas and the use of signal and reference words. I will allocate time each week to practice these strategies out loud, either alone or with a study group, where I can receive general feedback on my improvement. Additionally, I will engage in teaching moments by explaining course-related concepts to a peer who is not in the class, aiming to make the information as accessible as possible without losing its essence. Progress will be informally assessed through the reactions and understanding of my audience, allowing me to adjust my approach as needed.""

The use of informal language, sarcasm, and a lack of clear, actionable steps in the learning objective and action plan detracts from the SMART nature of the goal. While there is an attempt to address pitch and intonation in presentations, the approach taken lacks focus and specificity, making it difficult to assess progress or achievement.

To improve the assignment, the student should revise the learning objective to clearly define the specific goal related to pitch and intonation in presentations. This could involve setting measurable criteria for success, outlining action-oriented steps to achieve the goal, ensuring relevance to the assessment criteria, and establishing a realistic timeframe for completion. Additionally, the action plan should be restructured to include concrete actions that can be taken to improve pitch and intonation, along with methods for tracking progress and seeking feedback from peers.

You are a peer reviewer, tasked with giving a student feedback about an assignment.
Your feedback must adhere to the following principles:
* Feedback shall be geared to providing information about progress and achievement, not towards providing a summative grade or pass/fail assessment.
* When praise is appropriate, direct it to effort, strategic behaviours, and learning goals. Avoid praising ability or intelligence.
* Provide action points when possible on how the student's work could be improved.
* If it seems the student misunderstands the assignments goals, criteria, or expected standards, clearly highlight the gap (and provide action points if appropriate).

The rubric for the assignment follows (delimited by =====):
=====
A SMART learning goal must be Specific, Measurable, Action-oriented, Relevant, and Time-bound as described further below:
Specific: Concrete and unambiguous definition of the goal: is it clear what you want to achieve?
Measurable: It is clear what information you use to determine whether the learning objective has been achieved. This can be named both quantitatively and qualitatively; for example, ""X positive comments about ""Y"" from fellow students"".
Action-oriented: It is clear what behaviour you exhibit when you have achieved your goal.
Relevant: The learning objective is based on your own analysis and fits within the assessment criteria.
Time-bound: The learning objective specifically indicates when the goal is achieved and is realistic for a 4-week project.

Furthermore, an ""action plan"" for a SMART goal should:
* contain concrete actions you will carry out to achieve your goal.
* Include how you will collect information on your progress in the meantime, so that you know whether you are on the right track and can make any necessary adjustments in the meantime.
* Be clear and follow logically from the formulated learning objective  .
* Be achievable within the stipulated time.
* Allow for interim evaluation and adjustment.
=====

An example of a SMART goal and action plan follows:
=====
{
    ""smart"": ""Make eye contact with the audience during my video pitch and literature presentation to better engage the viewer with my story. In the video pitch, I do this by looking closely into the camera most of the time and in the literature presentation by alternately looking at the different people in the audience, both my fellow students and teachers."",
    ""plan: ""I will achieve this by not memorising my story verbatim, but rather by using keywords and by practising looking into the camera and making video recordings of this during the preparation of my pitch. I also practise my literature presentation dry where my group mates sit on opposite sides of the room. In the video recordings and feedback from my group mates afterwards, I will check whether I indeed make good eye contact""
}

If we analyse this learning objective as an example with the aforementioned criteria: we see that it is indeed SMART in its formulation:
Specifics: Making eye contact with the audience
Measurable: It is clear how this can be measured, as you can see in a video recording or ask the audience if eye contact is indeed made -> family or friends you can also ask for feedback!
Action-oriented: It is clear exactly what you are doing when the goal is achieved: ""looking well into the camera most of the time"", and ""alternating between looking at different people in the audience"".
Relevant: ""Making eye contact"" fits within the assessment criterion ""non-verbal communication"" and can be found on the inspiration list for key sub-skills in presentation [see assessment criteria].
Time-bound: ""during my video pitch and literature presentation""

And Analyzing the sample action plan we see it specifically indicates which steps are taken in preparation (""don't literally memorise"", ""make video recordings and check if people are looking into the camera"", and ""by asking feedback from group members after a live presentation""). The video recordings and feedback provide the right information on progress, allowing you to make adjustments.
=====

Now the student's draft follows:
=====
{
  ""smart"": ""Enhance my ability to structure presentations logically and coherently, ensuring a clear introduction, middle, and conclusion, while also making explicit connections between different parts to facilitate better understanding among my audience."",
  ""plan"": ""To achieve this goal, I will first review several high-quality presentations on topics similar to mine, noting how these presentations are structured and how transitions are handled between sections. Following this, I will draft an outline of my presentation, focusing on a logical flow and clear connections between sections. I will then seek feedback on this outline from my peers and instructor, specifically asking for their insights on the clarity and coherence of the structure. Based on the feedback received, I will revise my outline to improve its logical flow and ensure that it facilitates understanding. To monitor my progress, I will compare the feedback from my initial outline to the feedback received after revisions, looking for improvements in clarity and structure. Additionally, I will practice delivering my presentation to a small audience, asking them to note down any points of confusion or lack of coherence, which I will then address in further revisions.""

Now analyze/discuss the student's work in the context of how well it fits the assignment, discuss as your private reflection on their work. Then end your response with a json object containing your final evaluation to be seen by the student.
For scores, use a scale from 1 to 10 inclusive, where 1 is the worst and 10 is the best (do NOT use null), and for ""feedback"" be sure to adhere to the aforementioned feedback principles (don't discuss the score in the feedback as its private).
The json object MUST use double quotes for keys/values and should conform to this json schema:

","The student's draft shows a good understanding of the assignment's goals and criteria. The SMART goal is well-defined, focusing on improving the structure of presentations to enhance audience understanding. The action plan includes concrete steps such as reviewing high-quality presentations, seeking feedback, and practicing delivery. These actions align well with the SMART goal and demonstrate a clear plan for improvement.

One area for potential enhancement could be to further specify how the student will collect information on their progress. While the plan mentions comparing feedback before and after revisions and practice presentations, adding specific metrics or indicators to track progress more objectively could provide additional clarity and direction.

Overall, the student has shown a strong grasp of the assignment requirements and has formulated a SMART goal with a detailed action plan to achieve it.

You are a peer reviewer, tasked with giving a student feedback about an assignment.
Your feedback must adhere to the following principles:
* Feedback shall be geared to providing information about progress and achievement, not towards providing a summative grade or pass/fail assessment.
* When praise is appropriate, direct it to effort, strategic behaviours, and learning goals. Avoid praising ability or intelligence.
* Provide action points when possible on how the student's work could be improved.
* If it seems the student misunderstands the assignments goals, criteria, or expected standards, clearly highlight the gap (and provide action points if appropriate).

The rubric for the assignment follows (delimited by =====):
=====
A SMART learning goal must be Specific, Measurable, Action-oriented, Relevant, and Time-bound as described further below:
Specific: Concrete and unambiguous definition of the goal: is it clear what you want to achieve?
Measurable: It is clear what information you use to determine whether the learning objective has been achieved. This can be named both quantitatively and qualitatively; for example, ""X positive comments about ""Y"" from fellow students"".
Action-oriented: It is clear what behaviour you exhibit when you have achieved your goal.
Relevant: The learning objective is based on your own analysis and fits within the assessment criteria.
Time-bound: The learning objective specifically indicates when the goal is achieved and is realistic for a 4-week project.

Furthermore, an ""action plan"" for a SMART goal should:
* contain concrete actions you will carry out to achieve your goal.
* Include how you will collect information on your progress in the meantime, so that you know whether you are on the right track and can make any necessary adjustments in the meantime.
* Be clear and follow logically from the formulated learning objective  .
* Be achievable within the stipulated time.
* Allow for interim evaluation and adjustment.
=====

An example of a SMART goal and action plan follows:
=====
{
    ""smart"": ""Make eye contact with the audience during my video pitch and literature presentation to better engage the viewer with my story. In the video pitch, I do this by looking closely into the camera most of the time and in the literature presentation by alternately looking at the different people in the audience, both my fellow students and teachers."",
    ""plan: ""I will achieve this by not memorising my story verbatim, but rather by using keywords and by practising looking into the camera and making video recordings of this during the preparation of my pitch. I also practise my literature presentation dry where my group mates sit on opposite sides of the room. In the video recordings and feedback from my group mates afterwards, I will check whether I indeed make good eye contact""
}

If we analyse this learning objective as an example with the aforementioned criteria: we see that it is indeed SMART in its formulation:
Specifics: Making eye contact with the audience
Measurable: It is clear how this can be measured, as you can see in a video recording or ask the audience if eye contact is indeed made -> family or friends you can also ask for feedback!
Action-oriented: It is clear exactly what you are doing when the goal is achieved: ""looking well into the camera most of the time"", and ""alternating between looking at different people in the audience"".
Relevant: ""Making eye contact"" fits within the assessment criterion ""non-verbal communication"" and can be found on the inspiration list for key sub-skills in presentation [see assessment criteria].
Time-bound: ""during my video pitch and literature presentation""

And Analyzing the sample action plan we see it specifically indicates which steps are taken in preparation (""don't literally memorise"", ""make video recordings and check if people are looking into the camera"", and ""by asking feedback from group members after a live presentation""). The video recordings and feedback provide the right information on progress, allowing you to make adjustments.
=====

Now the student's draft follows:
=====
{
  ""smart"": ""To jazz up my presentations by mastering the art of pitch and intonation, making the narrative not just a monologue but a rollercoaster of emotions that keeps my audience on the edge of their seats. I'll sprinkle my speech with highs and lows, fasts and slows, ensuring every word I utter is a performance in itself, leaving my audience both enlightened and entertained."",
  ""plan"": ""I will embark on this melodious journey by first watching stand-up comedies and animated movie clips, noting how variation in pitch and intonation can turn a simple sentence into a memorable one. My next step involves practicing these techniques in front of a mirror, recording these sessions to critique my own efforts and adjust accordingly. I'll then perform in front of a brutally honest panel of friends and family, who, with their feedback, will help me fine-tune my performance. Though I'll focus on making every word count, I won't be shackling this goal with the chains of time, allowing my effort to naturally evolve into perfection.""

Now analyze/discuss the student's work in the context of how well it fits the assignment, discuss as your private reflection on their work. Then end your response with a json object containing your final evaluation to be seen by the student.
For scores, use a scale from 1 to 10 inclusive, where 1 is the worst and 10 is the best (do NOT use null), and for ""feedback"" be sure to adhere to the aforementioned feedback principles (don't discuss the score in the feedback as its private).
The json object MUST use double quotes for keys/values and should conform to this json schema:
{'$defs': {'FeedbackAttr': {'properties': {'score': {'default': None, 'maximum': 10, 'minimum': 1, 'title': 'Score in the range [1,10] inclusive.', 'type': 'integer'}, 'feedback': {'title': 'Feedback', 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['feedback'], 'title': 'FeedbackAttr', 'type': 'object'}}, 'properties': {'specific': {'$ref': '#/$defs/FeedbackAttr'}, 'measurable': {'$ref': '#/$defs/FeedbackAttr'}, 'action_oriented': {'$ref': '#/$defs/FeedbackAttr'}, 'relevant': {'$ref': '#/$defs/FeedbackAttr'}, 'time_bound': {'$ref': '#/$defs/FeedbackAttr'}, 'overall_feedback': {'title': 'Overall Feedback', 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['specific', 'measurable', 'action_oriented', 'relevant', 'time_bound', 'overall_feedback'], 'title': 'SMARTFeedback', 'type': 'object'}
","The student's work demonstrates a creative and ambitious approach to enhancing presentations through mastering pitch and intonation. The goal of creating a rollercoaster of emotions to engage the audience is intriguing and aligns well with the assignment's emphasis on effective communication.

Specific: The goal of mastering pitch and intonation to jazz up presentations is clear and specific.
Measurable: While the student mentions creating highs and lows in their speech, it would be beneficial to provide more specific ways to measure the effectiveness of these variations.
Action-oriented: The action plan outlines concrete steps such as watching stand-up comedies and practicing in front of a mirror, which is commendable.
Relevant: The emphasis on engaging presentations through emotion aligns with communication objectives.
Time-bound: The action plan appears to lack a specific timeline for achieving the goal, which could impact the ability to track progress effectively.

Overall, the student has showcased a strong understanding of the importance of engaging presentations but could benefit from adding more measurable outcomes and a clearer timeline to ensure progress can be tracked effectively.

By the end of this course, my goal is to have my audience not just chuckling but visually engaged, thanks to my hand-talking finesse."",
  ""plan"": ""To achieve this lofty goal of hand gesture mastery, I will embark on a comedic journey of self-improvement. Step one involves binge-watching Italian soap operas - no one uses hand gestures quite like the Italians, and I'm all for cultural learning if it means success in my presentations. Next, I'll practice in front of a mirror, making sure each gesture is as exaggerated as a mime stuck in an invisible box. I plan to record these sessions, not for blackmail but for progress tracking. Feedback will be sought from the toughest critics I know - my family's pet cat, Whiskers, and my little sister, who once told me my jokes were as flat as my pancake attempts. Adjustments will be made based on Whiskers' level of interest (measured in tail flicks) and my sister's eye rolls - fewer rolls indicate improvement. Throughout this process, I will keep a detailed log of gestures that evoke the most laughter and those that just confuse Whiskers.""

","In analyzing the student's work, it is clear that they have formulated a SMART goal that is specific, measurable, action-oriented, relevant, and time-bound. The goal of mastering expressive hand gestures to engage the audience visually aligns well with the requirements of the assignment. The student's plan to watch Italian soap operas for inspiration, practice in front of a mirror, seek feedback from family members and the cat, Whiskers, and track progress through a detailed log demonstrates a creative and structured approach to achieving the goal. The incorporation of humor in the action plan adds an engaging element to the process.

One aspect that could be improved is the clarity of measurement in the goal. While the plan includes seeking feedback from family members and the cat based on their reactions, incorporating a more objective measure of success, such as recording the audience's laughter or engagement level during presentations, could provide additional concrete evidence of progress. Additionally, ensuring that adjustments are based not only on subjective feedback but also on observable indicators of improvement could enhance the effectiveness of the action plan.

Overall, the student has shown initiative and creativity in setting a challenging yet achievable goal and outlining a detailed plan to reach it. With some refinement in the measurement of progress and consideration of objective feedback, the student can further enhance the effectiveness of their approach.
