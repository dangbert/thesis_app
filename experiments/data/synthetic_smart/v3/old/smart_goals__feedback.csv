1,pitch and intonation,"You're a student taking a course where you're tasked with writing a SMART goal defining your personal learning objective for the course.
A SMART learning goal must be Specific, Measurable, Action-oriented, Relevant, and Time-bound as described further below:
Specific: Concrete and unambiguous definition of the goal: is it clear what you want to achieve?
Measurable: It is clear what information you use to determine whether the learning objective has been achieved. This can be named both quantitatively and qualitatively; for example, ""X positive comments about ""Y"" from fellow students"".
Action-oriented: It is clear what behaviour you exhibit when you have achieved your goal.
Relevant: The learning objective is based on your own analysis and fits within the assessment criteria.
Time-bound: The learning objective specifically indicates when the goal is achieved and is realistic for a 4-week project.

Furthermore, an ""action plan"" for a SMART goal should:
* contain concrete actions you will carry out to achieve your goal.
* Include how you will collect information on your progress in the meantime, so that you know whether you are on the right track and can make any necessary adjustments in the meantime.
* Be clear and follow logically from the formulated learning objective  .
* Be achievable within the stipulated time.
* Allow for interim evaluation and adjustment.

Your response should contain a SMART goal written from your perspective as a student, as well as an appropriate action plan, formatted like the example response below (simple json object containing plain text data with no markdown formatting).
{
    ""smart"": ""Make eye contact with the audience during my video pitch and literature presentation to better engage the viewer with my story. In the video pitch, I do this by looking closely into the camera most of the time and in the literature presentation by alternately looking at the different people in the audience, both my fellow students and teachers."",
    ""plan: ""I will achieve this by not memorising my story verbatim, but rather by using keywords and by practising looking into the camera and making video recordings of this during the preparation of my pitch. I also practise my literature presentation dry where my group mates sit on opposite sides of the room. In the video recordings and feedback from my group mates afterwards, I will check whether I indeed make good eye contact""
}

If we analyse this learning objective as an example with the aforementioned criteria: we see that it is indeed SMART in its formulation:
Specifics: Making eye contact with the audience
Measurable: It is clear how this can be measured, as you can see in a video recording or ask the audience if eye contact is indeed made -> family or friends you can also ask for feedback!
Action-oriented: It is clear exactly what you are doing when the goal is achieved: ""looking well into the camera most of the time"", and ""alternating between looking at different people in the audience"".
Relevant: ""Making eye contact"" fits within the assessment criterion ""non-verbal communication"" and can be found on the inspiration list for key sub-skills in presentation [see assessment criteria].
Time-bound: ""during my video pitch and literature presentation""

And Analyzing the sample action plan we see it specifically indicates which steps are taken in preparation (""don't literally memorise"", ""make video recordings and check if people are looking into the camera"", and ""by asking feedback from group members after a live presentation""). The video recordings and feedback provide the right information on progress, allowing you to make adjustments.

In your case the goal you're writing should focus on a skill such as 'pitch and intonation' (for example using different pitches and intonation to make the presentation more engaging and understandable. Intonations can also be used to place emphasis on a specific part of a sentence to better guide the audience through the story.) and you shall write your goal/plan using a tone of voice such as 'sympathetic'.
And incorporate the word 'collaboration' into your response. 
Now respond only with a SMART goal written from your perspective as a student as well as an appropriate action plan in json format like the example. You do not have to adhere to the particular wording structure used in the example, just the json format.",sympathetic,,"By the end of the 4-week course, I aim to enhance my presentation skills by effectively using pitch and intonation to make my speech more engaging and understandable. This will be achieved by varying my pitch to emphasize key points and modulating my intonation to maintain audience interest throughout my presentations. My success will be measured by receiving positive feedback on my use of pitch and intonation from at least three peers and one instructor.","To accomplish this, I will begin by researching techniques for effective pitch and intonation control and incorporate these strategies into my daily speaking practice. I will collaborate with a study group to practice presentations and receive constructive feedback on my pitch and intonation. Additionally, I will record my practice sessions to self-evaluate and adjust my techniques as needed. Progress will be monitored through weekly reflection on feedback from my study group and adjustments will be made accordingly to ensure continuous improvement. By the end of the course, I aim to confidently use pitch and intonation to enhance my presentations, as evidenced by the targeted feedback.","
You are a peer reviewer, tasked with giving a student feedback about an assignment.
Your feedback must adhere to the following principles:
* Feedback shall be geared to providing information about progress and achievement, not towards providing a summative grade or pass/fail assessment.
* When praise is appropriate, direct it to effort, strategic behaviours, and learning goals. Avoid praising ability or intelligence.
* Provide action points when possible on how the student's work could be improved.
* If it seems the student misunderstands the assignments goals, criteria, or expected standards, clearly highlight the gap (and provide action points if appropriate).

Now analyze/discuss the student's work in the context of how well it fits the assignment, discuss as your private reflection on their work. Then end your response with a json object containing your final evaluation to be seen by the student.
For scores, use a scale from 1 to 10 inclusive, where 1 is the worst and 10 is the best (do NOT use null), and for ""feedback"" be sure to adhere to the aforementioned feedback principles (don't discuss the score in the feedback as its private).
The json object MUST use double quotes for keys/values and should conform to this json schema:
{'$defs': {'FeedbackAttr': {'properties': {'score': {'default': None, 'maximum': 10, 'minimum': 1, 'title': 'Score in the range [1,10] inclusive.', 'type': 'integer'}, 'feedback': {'title': 'Feedback', 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['feedback'], 'title': 'FeedbackAttr', 'type': 'object'}}, 'properties': {'specific': {'$ref': '#/$defs/FeedbackAttr'}, 'measurable': {'$ref': '#/$defs/FeedbackAttr'}, 'action_oriented': {'$ref': '#/$defs/FeedbackAttr'}, 'relevant': {'$ref': '#/$defs/FeedbackAttr'}, 'time_bound': {'$ref': '#/$defs/FeedbackAttr'}, 'overall_feedback': {'title': 'Overall Feedback', 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['specific', 'measurable', 'action_oriented', 'relevant', 'time_bound', 'overall_feedback'], 'title': 'SMARTFeedback', 'type': 'object'}
","The student's work shows a good understanding of setting a SMART learning goal and developing an action plan to achieve it. They have specified a clear objective related to enhancing presentation skills through pitch and intonation control, which is specific, measurable, action-oriented, relevant, and time-bound. The plan outlined by the student demonstrates concrete actions they will undertake, such as researching techniques, practicing with a study group, and self-evaluating through recordings.

One area for improvement could be in further detailing how the student will assess their progress beyond receiving feedback from peers and instructors. Adding specific criteria or indicators that they will use to track their improvement could enhance the clarity of their action plan.

Overall, the student has shown a strong effort in formulating a SMART goal and developing a feasible plan to achieve it. By incorporating additional measures for progress evaluation, the student can further enhance the effectiveness of their goal-setting and action plan.

Furthermore, an ""action plan"" for a SMART goal should:
* contain concrete actions you will carry out to achieve your goal.
* Include how you will collect information on your progress in the meantime, so that you know whether you are on the right track and can make any necessary adjustments in the meantime.
* Be clear and follow logically from the formulated learning objective  .
* Be achievable within the stipulated time.
* Allow for interim evaluation and adjustment.
=====

An example of a SMART goal and action plan follows:
=====
{
    ""smart"": ""Make eye contact with the audience during my video pitch and literature presentation to better engage the viewer with my story. In the video pitch, I do this by looking closely into the camera most of the time and in the literature presentation by alternately looking at the different people in the audience, both my fellow students and teachers."",
    ""plan: ""I will achieve this by not memorising my story verbatim, but rather by using keywords and by practising looking into the camera and making video recordings of this during the preparation of my pitch. I also practise my literature presentation dry where my group mates sit on opposite sides of the room. In the video recordings and feedback from my group mates afterwards, I will check whether I indeed make good eye contact""
}

If we analyse this learning objective as an example with the aforementioned criteria: we see that it is indeed SMART in its formulation:
Specifics: Making eye contact with the audience
Measurable: It is clear how this can be measured, as you can see in a video recording or ask the audience if eye contact is indeed made -> family or friends you can also ask for feedback!
Action-oriented: It is clear exactly what you are doing when the goal is achieved: ""looking well into the camera most of the time"", and ""alternating between looking at different people in the audience"".
Relevant: ""Making eye contact"" fits within the assessment criterion ""non-verbal communication"" and can be found on the inspiration list for key sub-skills in presentation [see assessment criteria].
Time-bound: ""during my video pitch and literature presentation""

And Analyzing the sample action plan we see it specifically indicates which steps are taken in preparation (""don't literally memorise"", ""make video recordings and check if people are looking into the camera"", and ""by asking feedback from group members after a live presentation""). The video recordings and feedback provide the right information on progress, allowing you to make adjustments.
=====

Now the student's draft follows:
=====
{
  ""smart"": ""Improve my use of precise, clear, and professional language in my upcoming presentation, ensuring I effectively use scientific terminology where appropriate and eliminate filler words. My effort will focus on making my language more impactful and understandable, aiming for at least three instances where my use of scientific terminology is directly linked to the clarity of the message conveyed."",
  ""plan"": ""To achieve this, I'll start by identifying key scientific terms that are relevant to my presentation topic and practice using them in sentences that are clear and concise. I'll record myself giving parts of the presentation, focusing on these terms and avoiding filler words. I'll review these recordings to identify areas for improvement and make adjustments. Additionally, I'll seek feedback from peers on my use of language after a practice presentation, specifically asking them to note the use of scientific terminology and the presence of filler words. This feedback will guide further refinement of my presentation skills. My progress will be tracked through the number of filler words used in each subsequent recording and the feedback from peers on the clarity and professionalism of my language.""
}
=====

Now analyze/discuss the student's work in the context of how well it fits the assignment, discuss as your private reflection on their work. Then end your response with a json object containing your final evaluation to be seen by the student.
For scores, use a scale from 1 to 10 inclusive, where 1 is the worst and 10 is the best (do NOT use null), and for ""feedback"" be sure to adhere to the aforementioned feedback principles (don't discuss the score in the feedback as its private).
The json object MUST use double quotes for keys/values and should conform to this json schema:
{'$defs': {'FeedbackAttr': {'properties': {'score': {'default': None, 'maximum': 10, 'minimum': 1, 'title': 'Score in the range [1,10] inclusive.', 'type': 'integer'}, 'feedback': {'title': 'Feedback', 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['feedback'], 'title': 'FeedbackAttr', 'type': 'object'}}, 'properties': {'specific': {'$ref': '#/$defs/FeedbackAttr'}, 'measurable': {'$ref': '#/$defs/FeedbackAttr'}, 'action_oriented': {'$ref': '#/$defs/FeedbackAttr'}, 'relevant': {'$ref': '#/$defs/FeedbackAttr'}, 'time_bound': {'$ref': '#/$defs/FeedbackAttr'}, 'overall_feedback': {'title': 'Overall Feedback', 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['specific', 'measurable', 'action_oriented', 'relevant', 'time_bound', 'overall_feedback'], 'title': 'SMARTFeedback', 'type': 'object'}
","In analyzing the student's work, it is evident that they have formulated a SMART goal and action plan that align well with the assignment criteria. The goal is specific in targeting the improvement of language use in a presentation, measurable through the monitoring of filler words and feedback on the clarity of scientific terminology, action-oriented in practicing and seeking feedback, relevant to the assessment criteria, and time-bound within a realistic timeframe.

The action plan laid out by the student is detailed and logical, outlining concrete steps to achieve the goal of enhancing language proficiency in the presentation. The inclusion of practicing with key scientific terms, recording and reviewing presentations, seeking feedback from peers, and tracking progress through specific metrics demonstrates a thoughtful and structured approach to skill development.

Overall, the student's work showcases a strong understanding of SMART goal setting and action planning in the context of presentation skills improvement. With dedication to implementing the outlined steps and a commitment to reflection and adjustment based on feedback, the student is on track to make tangible progress in enhancing their language proficiency in presentations.

While the student mentions feedback from peers sitting in different parts of the room, incorporating feedback from individuals with varying hearing abilities or backgrounds could provide a more comprehensive evaluation.

Overall, the student has shown a strong understanding of the assignment requirements and has developed a detailed and coherent plan to achieve their learning goal. By continuing to seek feedback from a broad range of sources and adjusting their techniques accordingly, the student is on track to make significant progress in their presentation skills.

A SMART learning goal must be Specific, Measurable, Action-oriented, Relevant, and Time-bound as described further below:
Specific: Concrete and unambiguous definition of the goal: is it clear what you want to achieve?
Measurable: It is clear what information you use to determine whether the learning objective has been achieved. This can be named both quantitatively and qualitatively; for example, ""X positive comments about ""Y"" from fellow students"".
Action-oriented: It is clear what behaviour you exhibit when you have achieved your goal.
Relevant: The learning objective is based on your own analysis and fits within the assessment criteria.
Time-bound: The learning objective specifically indicates when the goal is achieved and is realistic for a 4-week project.

Furthermore, an ""action plan"" for a SMART goal should:
* contain concrete actions you will carry out to achieve your goal.
* Include how you will collect information on your progress in the meantime, so that you know whether you are on the right track and can make any necessary adjustments in the meantime.

You are a peer reviewer, tasked with giving a student feedback about an assignment.
Your feedback must adhere to the following principles:
* Feedback shall be geared to providing information about progress and achievement, not towards providing a summative grade or pass/fail assessment.
* When praise is appropriate, direct it to effort, strategic behaviours, and learning goals. Avoid praising ability or intelligence.
* Provide action points when possible on how the student's work could be improved.

You are a peer reviewer, tasked with giving a student feedback about an assignment.
Your feedback must adhere to the following principles:
* Feedback shall be geared to providing information about progress and achievement, not towards providing a summative grade or pass/fail assessment.
* When praise is appropriate, direct it to effort, strategic behaviours, and learning goals. Avoid praising ability or intelligence.
* Provide action points when possible on how the student's work could be improved.
* If it seems the student misunderstands the assignments goals, criteria, or expected standards, clearly highlight the gap (and provide action points if appropriate).

The rubric for the assignment follows (delimited by =====):
=====
A SMART learning goal must be Specific, Measurable, Action-oriented, Relevant, and Time-bound as described further below:
Specific: Concrete and unambiguous definition of the goal: is it clear what you want to achieve?
Measurable: It is clear what information you use to determine whether the learning objective has been achieved. This can be named both quantitatively and qualitatively; for example, ""X positive comments about ""Y"" from fellow students"".
Action-oriented: It is clear what behaviour you exhibit when you have achieved your goal.
Relevant: The learning objective is based on your own analysis and fits within the assessment criteria.
Time-bound: The learning objective specifically indicates when the goal is achieved and is realistic for a 4-week project.

Furthermore, an ""action plan"" for a SMART goal should:
* contain concrete actions you will carry out to achieve your goal.
* Include how you will collect information on your progress in the meantime, so that you know whether you are on the right track and can make any necessary adjustments in the meantime.
* Be clear and follow logically from the formulated learning objective  .
* Be achievable within the stipulated time.
* Allow for interim evaluation and adjustment.
=====

An example of a SMART goal and action plan follows:
=====
{
    ""smart"": ""Make eye contact with the audience during my video pitch and literature presentation to better engage the viewer with my story. In the video pitch, I do this by looking closely into the camera most of the time and in the literature presentation by alternately looking at the different people in the audience, both my fellow students and teachers."",
    ""plan: ""I will achieve this by not memorising my story verbatim, but rather by using keywords and by practising looking into the camera and making video recordings of this during the preparation of my pitch. I also practise my literature presentation dry where my group mates sit on opposite sides of the room. In the video recordings and feedback from my group mates afterwards, I will check whether I indeed make good eye contact""
}

If we analyse this learning objective as an example with the aforementioned criteria: we see that it is indeed SMART in its formulation:
Specifics: Making eye contact with the audience
Measurable: It is clear how this can be measured, as you can see in a video recording or ask the audience if eye contact is indeed made -> family or friends you can also ask for feedback!
Action-oriented: It is clear exactly what you are doing when the goal is achieved: ""looking well into the camera most of the time"", and ""alternating between looking at different people in the audience"".
Relevant: ""Making eye contact"" fits within the assessment criterion ""non-verbal communication"" and can be found on the inspiration list for key sub-skills in presentation [see assessment criteria].
Time-bound: ""during my video pitch and literature presentation""

And Analyzing the sample action plan we see it specifically indicates which steps are taken in preparation (""don't literally memorise"", ""make video recordings and check if people are looking into the camera"", and ""by asking feedback from group members after a live presentation""). The video recordings and feedback provide the right information on progress, allowing you to make adjustments.
=====

Now the student's draft follows:
=====
{
  ""smart"": ""To advance my understanding and application of non-verbal communication cues, specifically through the improvement of my posture and gestures during presentations to convey confidence and engage the audience more effectively. By the end of the 4-week project, I aim to receive at least 3 positive comments on my improved posture and gestures from my peers and instructors."",
  ""plan"": ""To achieve this advancement, I will start by researching and watching videos on effective non-verbal communication techniques used by public speakers. I will practice these techniques daily in front of a mirror, focusing on maintaining an open posture and using purposeful gestures that complement my verbal messages.

Now analyze/discuss the student's work in the context of how well it fits the assignment, discuss as your private reflection on their work. Then end your response with a json object containing your final evaluation to be seen by the student.
For scores, use a scale from 1 to 10 inclusive, where 1 is the worst and 10 is the best (do NOT use null), and for ""feedback"" be sure to adhere to the aforementioned feedback principles (don't discuss the score in the feedback as its private).
The json object MUST use double quotes for keys/values and should conform to this json schema:
{'$defs': {'FeedbackAttr': {'properties': {'score': {'default': None, 'maximum': 10, 'minimum': 1, 'title': 'Score in the range [1,10] inclusive.', 'type': 'integer'}, 'feedback': {'title': 'Feedback', 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['feedback'], 'title': 'FeedbackAttr', 'type': 'object'}}, 'properties': {'specific': {'$ref': '#/$defs/FeedbackAttr'}, 'measurable': {'$ref': '#/$defs/FeedbackAttr'}, 'action_oriented': {'$ref': '#/$defs/FeedbackAttr'}, 'relevant': {'$ref': '#/$defs/FeedbackAttr'}, 'time_bound': {'$ref': '#/$defs/FeedbackAttr'}, 'overall_feedback': {'title': 'Overall Feedback', 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['specific', 'measurable', 'action_oriented', 'relevant', 'time_bound', 'overall_feedback'], 'title': 'SMARTFeedback', 'type': 'object'}
","In reviewing your SMART goal and action plan, it is evident that you have formulated a specific and measurable learning objective related to non-verbal communication cues. Your goal of receiving positive comments on improved posture and gestures shows a clear understanding of what you want to achieve. Your action plan also outlines concrete steps you will take to work towards your goal, including researching techniques, practicing daily, recording presentations, and seeking feedback.

One area for improvement is ensuring that your actions are directly tied to your goal. For instance, while watching videos and practicing in front of a mirror are valuable steps, it may be beneficial to incorporate specific feedback mechanisms related to posture and gestures into your plan. Consider including how you will monitor and evaluate your progress in terms of these specific aspects during your practice sessions.

Additionally, it could be helpful to set more specific criteria for what constitutes improved posture and gestures. Defining what success looks like in terms of body language can guide your practice efforts and make it easier to track your progress.

Overall, your SMART goal and action plan show promise in terms of advancing your understanding and application of non-verbal communication cues. With some adjustments to ensure alignment between actions and goals, as well as clear criteria for success, you are on track to make meaningful progress in this area.

The plan outlines concrete steps, such as researching techniques, drafting the presentation with humor elements, and practicing in front of an audience for feedback and adjustment.

One area of improvement could be to ensure that the goal is more quantifiable. While the student mentions aiming for at least three instances of laughter, it might be beneficial to include a specific number or percentage as a target for improvement. Additionally, setting more specific criteria for what constitutes effective use of humor could further enhance the clarity of the goal.

Now analyze/discuss the student's work in the context of how well it fits the assignment, discuss as your private reflection on their work. Then end your response with a json object containing your final evaluation to be seen by the student.
For scores, use a scale from 1 to 10 inclusive, where 1 is the worst and 10 is the best (do NOT use null), and for ""feedback"" be sure to adhere to the aforementioned feedback principles (don't discuss the score in the feedback as its private).
The json object MUST use double quotes for keys/values and should conform to this json schema:
{'$defs': {'FeedbackAttr': {'properties': {'score': {'default': None, 'maximum': 10, 'minimum': 1, 'title': 'Score in the range [1,10] inclusive.', 'type': 'integer'}, 'feedback': {'title': 'Feedback', 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['feedback'], 'title': 'FeedbackAttr', 'type': 'object'}}, 'properties': {'specific': {'$ref': '#/$defs/FeedbackAttr'}, 'measurable': {'$ref': '#/$defs/FeedbackAttr'}, 'action_oriented': {'$ref': '#/$defs/FeedbackAttr'}, 'relevant': {'$ref': '#/$defs/FeedbackAttr'}, 'time_bound': {'$ref': '#/$defs/FeedbackAttr'}, 'overall_feedback': {'title': 'Overall Feedback', 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['specific', 'measurable', 'action_oriented', 'relevant', 'time_bound', 'overall_feedback'], 'title': 'SMARTFeedback', 'type': 'object'}
","In analyzing the student's work, it is clear that they have made significant progress in formulating a SMART learning goal and action plan. The goal is specific, measurable, action-oriented, relevant, and time-bound, aligning well with the requirements of the assignment. The student's focus on improving time management and speaking pace during presentations to ensure clarity and engagement is commendable. The plan to outline presentations, time each section, record rehearsals for self-assessment, seek feedback, and make adjustments accordingly demonstrates a structured approach towards achieving the set goal.

One area for improvement could be the specificity of the measurement criteria. While it is stated that the goal will be measured by successfully delivering two presentations within the next four weeks fitting precisely within the assigned time limits, without omitting crucial points, there could be more clarity on how the measurement process will be carried out and what specific indicators will be used to determine success. Providing more details on how success will be evaluated can enhance the effectiveness of the goal.

Overall, the student has shown a strong understanding of the SMART goal framework and has developed a well-thought-out plan to work towards their objective. With some enhancements in the measurement aspect, the student's work can be further strengthened.

A SMART learning goal must be Specific, Measurable, Action-oriented, Relevant, and Time-bound as described further below:
Specific: Concrete and unambiguous definition of the goal: is it clear what you want to achieve?
Measurable: It is clear what information you use to determine whether the learning objective has been achieved. This can be named both quantitatively and qualitatively; for example, ""X positive comments about ""Y"" from fellow students"".
Action-oriented: It is clear what behaviour you exhibit when you have achieved your goal.
Relevant: The learning objective is based on your own analysis and fits within the assessment criteria.
Time-bound: The learning objective specifically indicates when the goal is achieved and is realistic for a 4-week project.

Furthermore, an ""action plan"" for a SMART goal should:
* contain concrete actions you will carry out to achieve your goal.
* Include how you will collect information on your progress in the meantime, so that you know whether you are on the right track and can make any necessary adjustments in the meantime.
* Be clear and follow logically from the formulated learning objective  .
* Be achievable within the stipulated time.
* Allow for interim evaluation and adjustment.

Your response should contain a SMART goal written from your perspective as a student, as well as an appropriate action plan, formatted like the example response below (simple json object containing plain text data with no markdown formatting).

}

If we analyse this learning objective as an example with the aforementioned criteria: we see that it is indeed SMART in its formulation:
Specifics: Making eye contact with the audience
Measurable: It is clear how this can be measured, as you can see in a video recording or ask the audience if eye contact is indeed made -> family or friends you can also ask for feedback!
Action-oriented: It is clear exactly what you are doing when the goal is achieved: ""looking well into the camera most of the time"", and ""alternating between looking at different people in the audience"".
Relevant: ""Making eye contact"" fits within the assessment criterion ""non-verbal communication"" and can be found on the inspiration list for key sub-skills in presentation [see assessment criteria].
Time-bound: ""during my video pitch and literature presentation""

And Analyzing the sample action plan we see it specifically indicates which steps are taken in preparation (""don't literally memorise"", ""make video recordings and check if people are looking into the camera"", and ""by asking feedback from group members after a live presentation""). The video recordings and feedback provide the right information on progress, allowing you to make adjustments.

In your case the goal you're writing should focus on a skill such as 'non-verbal communication' (for example eye contact: the ability to make contact with the audience and involve them in the story by consciously looking at them (e.g. looking into the camera) and distributing attention evenly across the audience) and you shall write your goal/plan using a tone of voice such as 'empathetic'.
And incorporate the word 'knowledge' into your response.

Your feedback must adhere to the following principles:
* Feedback shall be geared to providing information about progress and achievement, not towards providing a summative grade or pass/fail assessment.
* When praise is appropriate, direct it to effort, strategic behaviours, and learning goals. Avoid praising ability or intelligence.
* Provide action points when possible on how the student's work could be improved.

","In analyzing the student's work, it is clear that they have made a commendable effort to create a SMART learning goal and action plan. The SMART goal is specific in targeting the improvement of their tone of voice during presentations to appear more engaging to the audience. It is measurable by aiming to receive feedback confirming the improvement in their vocal delivery. The goal is action-oriented as it outlines specific steps such as recording themselves reading various texts and seeking feedback to make adjustments. The relevance of the goal is evident as effective vocal delivery is essential in engaging an audience during presentations. The time-bound aspect is also addressed by setting a goal to achieve this improvement by the end of the 4-week project.

Furthermore, the action plan provided by the student is detailed and follows logically from the formulated learning objective. The plan includes concrete actions such as practicing inflections and emotion through reading different texts and seeking feedback from friends and family. The plan also incorporates a method for collecting information on progress through feedback and continual adjustment based on the feedback received.

If we analyse this learning objective as an example with the aforementioned criteria: we see that it is indeed SMART in its formulation:
Specifics: Making eye contact with the audience
Measurable: It is clear how this can be measured, as you can see in a video recording or ask the audience if eye contact is indeed made -> family or friends you can also ask for feedback!
Action-oriented: It is clear exactly what you are doing when the goal is achieved: ""looking well into the camera most of the time"", and ""alternating between looking at different people in the audience"".
Relevant: ""Making eye contact"" fits within the assessment criterion ""non-verbal communication"" and can be found on the inspiration list for key sub-skills in presentation [see assessment criteria].
Time-bound: ""during my video pitch and literature presentation""

And Analyzing the sample action plan we see it specifically indicates which steps are taken in preparation (""don't literally memorise"", ""make video recordings and check if people are looking into the camera"", and ""by asking feedback from group members after a live presentation""). The video recordings and feedback provide the right information on progress, allowing you to make adjustments.

In your case the goal you're writing should focus on a skill such as 'hand gestures' (for example ability to use hand gestures that support and thereby reinforce the spoken message. Consider, for example, counting with the hands when 3 main points are mentioned, or emphasizing the 'one' versus the 'other' side of the matter, etc. !.) and you shall write your goal/plan using a tone of voice such as 'cynical'.
And incorporate the word 'training' into your response. 
Now respond only with a SMART goal written from your perspective as a student as well as an appropriate action plan in json format like the example. You do not have to adhere to the particular wording structure used in the example, just the json format.",cynical,,"Master the art of using hand gestures to emphasize my spoken words during presentations, because apparently, flailing my arms with purpose can magically transform me into a more engaging speaker. Specifically, I will use hand gestures to count out main points, and to visually differentiate between contrasting ideas, making my presentations not just a feast for the ears but a circus for the eyes as well.","To achieve this spectacle, I will undergo a rigorous training regime, starting with watching an excessive number of TED Talks to analyze the hand gesture sorcery of seasoned speakers. Following this, I'll practice in front of a mirror, counting imaginary points and weighing invisible options in my hands, to ensure my gestures don't come off as an attempt to swat invisible flies. I'll record these sessions, because nothing screams progress like watching yourself trying to mime your way through complex topics. Feedback will be solicited from friends and family, who I'm sure will relish the opportunity to critique my newfound gesturing prowess. This cycle of watch, practice, record, and feedback will continue until I can confidently say my hand gestures add, rather than detract, from my presentations, all within the laughably short span of four weeks.","
You are a peer reviewer, tasked with giving a student feedback about an assignment.
Your feedback must adhere to the following principles:
* Feedback shall be geared to providing information about progress and achievement, not towards providing a summative grade or pass/fail assessment.
* When praise is appropriate, direct it to effort, strategic behaviours, and learning goals. Avoid praising ability or intelligence.
* Provide action points when possible on how the student's work could be improved.
* If it seems the student misunderstands the assignments goals, criteria, or expected standards, clearly highlight the gap (and provide action points if appropriate).

The rubric for the assignment follows (delimited by =====):
=====
A SMART learning goal must be Specific, Measurable, Action-oriented, Relevant, and Time-bound as described further below:
Specific: Concrete and unambiguous definition of the goal: is it clear what you want to achieve?
Measurable: It is clear what information you use to determine whether the learning objective has been achieved. This can be named both quantitatively and qualitatively; for example, ""X positive comments about ""Y"" from fellow students"".
Action-oriented: It is clear what behaviour you exhibit when you have achieved your goal.
Relevant: The learning objective is based on your own analysis and fits within the assessment criteria.
Time-bound: The learning objective specifically indicates when the goal is achieved and is realistic for a 4-week project.

Furthermore, an ""action plan"" for a SMART goal should:
* contain concrete actions you will carry out to achieve your goal.
* Include how you will collect information on your progress in the meantime, so that you know whether you are on the right track and can make any necessary adjustments in the meantime.
* Be clear and follow logically from the formulated learning objective  .
* Be achievable within the stipulated time.
* Allow for interim evaluation and adjustment.

In the video pitch, I do this by looking closely into the camera most of the time and in the literature presentation by alternately looking at the different people in the audience, both my fellow students and teachers."",
    ""plan: ""I will achieve this by not memorising my story verbatim, but rather by using keywords and by practising looking into the camera and making video recordings of this during the preparation of my pitch.

Now analyze/discuss the student's work in the context of how well it fits the assignment, discuss as your private reflection on their work. Then end your response with a json object containing your final evaluation to be seen by the student.
For scores, use a scale from 1 to 10 inclusive, where 1 is the worst and 10 is the best (do NOT use null), and for ""feedback"" be sure to adhere to the aforementioned feedback principles (don't discuss the score in the feedback as its private).
The json object MUST use double quotes for keys/values and should conform to this json schema:
{'$defs': {'FeedbackAttr': {'properties': {'score': {'default': None, 'maximum': 10, 'minimum': 1, 'title': 'Score in the range [1,10] inclusive.', 'type': 'integer'}, 'feedback': {'title': 'Feedback', 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['feedback'], 'title': 'FeedbackAttr', 'type': 'object'}}, 'properties': {'specific': {'$ref': '#/$defs/FeedbackAttr'}, 'measurable': {'$ref': '#/$defs/FeedbackAttr'}, 'action_oriented': {'$ref': '#/$defs/FeedbackAttr'}, 'relevant': {'$ref': '#/$defs/FeedbackAttr'}, 'time_bound': {'$ref': '#/$defs/FeedbackAttr'}, 'overall_feedback': {'title': 'Overall Feedback', 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['specific', 'measurable', 'action_oriented', 'relevant', 'time_bound', 'overall_feedback'], 'title': 'SMARTFeedback', 'type': 'object'}
","In analyzing the student's work, it is evident that they have formulated a SMART learning goal and action plan that align with the assignment requirements. The specificity of mastering hand gestures to enhance presentations is clearly defined. Measurability is addressed through the intention to visually differentiate ideas and count main points using hand gestures. The action-oriented approach of studying TED Talks for analysis, practicing in front of a mirror, recording sessions, and seeking feedback from others shows a proactive strategy. The relevance of this goal to presentation skills is well-established, and the time-bound nature of achieving this within four weeks is realistic.

The student's plan demonstrates a creative and engaging approach to improving their presentation skills through the effective use of hand gestures. The cycle of watching, practicing, recording, and seeking feedback is a comprehensive method that allows for continuous improvement in a structured manner. The student's humor and self-awareness in the writing also contribute to the overall appeal of the action plan.

Overall, the student has shown a strong understanding of the assignment requirements and has crafted a SMART goal and action plan that are detailed, achievable, and relevant to the learning objectives.

}

If we analyse this learning objective as an example with the aforementioned criteria: we see that it is indeed SMART in its formulation:
Specifics: Making eye contact with the audience
Measurable: It is clear how this can be measured, as you can see in a video recording or ask the audience if eye contact is indeed made -> family or friends you can also ask for feedback!
Action-oriented: It is clear exactly what you are doing when the goal is achieved: ""looking well into the camera most of the time"", and ""alternating between looking at different people in the audience"".
Relevant: ""Making eye contact"" fits within the assessment criterion ""non-verbal communication"" and can be found on the inspiration list for key sub-skills in presentation [see assessment criteria].
Time-bound: ""during my video pitch and literature presentation""

And Analyzing the sample action plan we see it specifically indicates which steps are taken in preparation (""don't literally memorise"", ""make video recordings and check if people are looking into the camera"", and ""by asking feedback from group members after a live presentation""). The video recordings and feedback provide the right information on progress, allowing you to make adjustments.

Now the student's draft follows:
=====
{
  ""smart"": ""By the end of the 4-week project, I aim to enhance my presentation skills by effectively using pitch and intonation to make my speech more engaging and understandable. Specifically, I will use varied pitches to emphasize key points and modulate my intonation to guide the audience through the narrative of my project on innovation, ensuring that my delivery captivates my audience's attention and facilitates a clearer understanding of complex concepts."",
  ""plan"": ""To achieve this, I will start by researching techniques for effective pitch and intonation control and apply these techniques to my project presentation. I will create a detailed script of my presentation, highlighting sections where varied pitch and intonation are crucial for emphasis. I will practice my presentation multiple times, recording each session to analyze my pitch and intonation. Feedback will be sought from peers and mentors on these recordings, focusing on how well I use pitch and intonation to enhance understanding and engagement. Based on the feedback, I will adjust my techniques accordingly. To measure my progress, I will aim for at least three positive comments from different individuals on my use of pitch and intonation by the end of the project. Additionally, I will reflect on my own comfort and confidence in using these techniques as a qualitative measure of my improvement.""
}
=====

Now analyze/discuss the student's work in the context of how well it fits the assignment, discuss as your private reflection on their work. Then end your response with a json object containing your final evaluation to be seen by the student.
For scores, use a scale from 1 to 10 inclusive, where 1 is the worst and 10 is the best (do NOT use null), and for ""feedback"" be sure to adhere to the aforementioned feedback principles (don't discuss the score in the feedback as its private).
The json object MUST use double quotes for keys/values and should conform to this json schema:
{'$defs': {'FeedbackAttr': {'properties': {'score': {'default': None, 'maximum': 10, 'minimum': 1, 'title': 'Score in the range [1,10] inclusive.', 'type': 'integer'}, 'feedback': {'title': 'Feedback', 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['feedback'], 'title': 'FeedbackAttr', 'type': 'object'}}, 'properties': {'specific': {'$ref': '#/$defs/FeedbackAttr'}, 'measurable': {'$ref': '#/$defs/FeedbackAttr'}, 'action_oriented': {'$ref': '#/$defs/FeedbackAttr'}, 'relevant': {'$ref': '#/$defs/FeedbackAttr'}, 'time_bound': {'$ref': '#/$defs/FeedbackAttr'}, 'overall_feedback': {'title': 'Overall Feedback', 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['specific', 'measurable', 'action_oriented', 'relevant', 'time_bound', 'overall_feedback'], 'title': 'SMARTFeedback', 'type': 'object'}
","Upon reviewing your SMART goal and action plan, it is evident that you have demonstrated a clear understanding of the assignment's goals and criteria. Your goal of enhancing presentation skills by effectively using pitch and intonation to engage the audience and facilitate understanding aligns well with the requirements of a SMART goal. Your plan to research techniques, create a detailed script, practice presentations, seek feedback, and set measurable benchmarks for improvement shows a structured approach to achieving your goal.

In terms of specificity, your goal clearly outlines the specific skills you aim to develop - pitch and intonation control for emphasis and narrative guidance. The measurability aspect is well-covered by setting a target of receiving positive comments and reflecting on your comfort and confidence levels. Your action-oriented approach of practicing, recording, and seeking feedback is commendable as it provides a clear path for skill development. Furthermore, your goal is relevant to the assessment criteria and time-bound within the 4-week project timeline.

Overall, your SMART goal and action plan demonstrate a strong grasp of the assignment's requirements and a well-thought-out strategy for improvement. To enhance your work further, consider incorporating specific examples of how you will apply varied pitch and intonation in your presentation and consider seeking feedback not just on the technique but also on the impact it has on the audience's engagement and understanding.

The action plan provided by the student is detailed and outlines specific steps to achieve the goal. The student plans to outline presentations, conduct research, create a checklist, seek feedback, and make necessary adjustments. The student has also considered measuring progress through feedback and adjustments based on that feedback.

One aspect that could be further improved is the specificity of the actions related to incorporating an analysis segment in the presentation. The student could provide more specific details on how this analysis will be integrated and its impact on the overall structure.

A SMART learning goal must be Specific, Measurable, Action-oriented, Relevant, and Time-bound as described further below:
Specific: Concrete and unambiguous definition of the goal: is it clear what you want to achieve?
Measurable: It is clear what information you use to determine whether the learning objective has been achieved. This can be named both quantitatively and qualitatively; for example, ""X positive comments about ""Y"" from fellow students"".
Action-oriented: It is clear what behaviour you exhibit when you have achieved your goal.
Relevant: The learning objective is based on your own analysis and fits within the assessment criteria.
Time-bound: The learning objective specifically indicates when the goal is achieved and is realistic for a 4-week project.

Furthermore, an ""action plan"" for a SMART goal should:
* contain concrete actions you will carry out to achieve your goal.
* Include how you will collect information on your progress in the meantime, so that you know whether you are on the right track and can make any necessary adjustments in the meantime.
* Be clear and follow logically from the formulated learning objective  .
* Be achievable within the stipulated time.
* Allow for interim evaluation and adjustment.

}

If we analyse this learning objective as an example with the aforementioned criteria: we see that it is indeed SMART in its formulation:
Specifics: Making eye contact with the audience
Measurable: It is clear how this can be measured, as you can see in a video recording or ask the audience if eye contact is indeed made -> family or friends you can also ask for feedback!
Action-oriented: It is clear exactly what you are doing when the goal is achieved: ""looking well into the camera most of the time"", and ""alternating between looking at different people in the audience"".
Relevant: ""Making eye contact"" fits within the assessment criterion ""non-verbal communication"" and can be found on the inspiration list for key sub-skills in presentation [see assessment criteria].
Time-bound: ""during my video pitch and literature presentation""

And Analyzing the sample action plan we see it specifically indicates which steps are taken in preparation (""don't literally memorise"", ""make video recordings and check if people are looking into the camera"", and ""by asking feedback from group members after a live presentation""). The video recordings and feedback provide the right information on progress, allowing you to make adjustments.

In your case the goal you're writing should focus on a skill such as 'language use' (for example ability to use precise, clear and professional language, including the appropriate use of scientific terminology. Spaces between sentences are not filled with distracting filler words, but rather used strategically to get the message across to the audience.) and you shall write your goal/plan using a tone of voice such as 'empathetic'.
And incorporate the word 'development' into your response.

You are a peer reviewer, tasked with giving a student feedback about an assignment.
Your feedback must adhere to the following principles:
* Feedback shall be geared to providing information about progress and achievement, not towards providing a summative grade or pass/fail assessment.
* When praise is appropriate, direct it to effort, strategic behaviours, and learning goals. Avoid praising ability or intelligence.
* Provide action points when possible on how the student's work could be improved.

Now analyze/discuss the student's work in the context of how well it fits the assignment, discuss as your private reflection on their work. Then end your response with a json object containing your final evaluation to be seen by the student.
For scores, use a scale from 1 to 10 inclusive, where 1 is the worst and 10 is the best (do NOT use null), and for ""feedback"" be sure to adhere to the aforementioned feedback principles (don't discuss the score in the feedback as its private).
The json object MUST use double quotes for keys/values and should conform to this json schema:

","Upon reviewing your SMART goal and action plan, it is evident that you have a clear understanding of what you want to achieve in terms of enhancing your language in presentations. Your goal to focus on using precise, clear, and professional language, including scientific terminology, is specific and relevant to the task at hand. Your action plan of reviewing feedback, incorporating scientific terms, practicing delivery, recording sessions, seeking feedback, and adjusting based on observations shows a proactive approach to achieving your goal.

To further improve your work, consider making your goal even more measurable by specifying a quantifiable metric to determine success, such as the number of filler words used per minute or the percentage of scientific terms integrated accurately. Additionally, ensure that your action plan includes specific timelines for each step to make it more time-bound and track progress effectively within the four-week timeframe.

Overall, your initiative in setting a SMART goal and detailing an action plan to achieve it is commendable. By enhancing the measurability and time-bound aspects of your goal, you can further enhance the clarity and effectiveness of your language in presentations.

The plan details concrete actions, such as analyzing speeches, daily practice sessions, recording for self-evaluation, seeking feedback, and incorporating specific exercises to improve vocal range and control. The student also includes a method for tracking progress through feedback logs and personal reflections, allowing for ongoing refinement.

One aspect for improvement could be to provide more specificity in how the student will incorporate feedback from peers and mentors, ensuring that they have a structured approach to implement the feedback effectively. Additionally, setting specific criteria for what constitutes successful incorporation of vocal exercises suggested by a vocal coach could enhance the action plan's clarity.

Overall, the student has demonstrated a good understanding of setting a SMART goal and devising a detailed action plan to achieve it.

* Provide action points when possible on how the student's work could be improved.
* If it seems the student misunderstands the assignments goals, criteria, or expected standards, clearly highlight the gap (and provide action points if appropriate).

The rubric for the assignment follows (delimited by =====):
=====
A SMART learning goal must be Specific, Measurable, Action-oriented, Relevant, and Time-bound as described further below:
Specific: Concrete and unambiguous definition of the goal: is it clear what you want to achieve?
Measurable: It is clear what information you use to determine whether the learning objective has been achieved. This can be named both quantitatively and qualitatively; for example, ""X positive comments about ""Y"" from fellow students"".
Action-oriented: It is clear what behaviour you exhibit when you have achieved your goal.
Relevant: The learning objective is based on your own analysis and fits within the assessment criteria.
Time-bound: The learning objective specifically indicates when the goal is achieved and is realistic for a 4-week project.

Furthermore, an ""action plan"" for a SMART goal should:
* contain concrete actions you will carry out to achieve your goal.
* Include how you will collect information on your progress in the meantime, so that you know whether you are on the right track and can make any necessary adjustments in the meantime.
* Be clear and follow logically from the formulated learning objective  .
* Be achievable within the stipulated time.
* Allow for interim evaluation and adjustment.
=====

An example of a SMART goal and action plan follows:
=====
{
    ""smart"": ""Make eye contact with the audience during my video pitch and literature presentation to better engage the viewer with my story. In the video pitch, I do this by looking closely into the camera most of the time and in the literature presentation by alternately looking at the different people in the audience, both my fellow students and teachers."",
    ""plan: ""I will achieve this by not memorising my story verbatim, but rather by using keywords and by practising looking into the camera and making video recordings of this during the preparation of my pitch. I also practise my literature presentation dry where my group mates sit on opposite sides of the room. In the video recordings and feedback from my group mates afterwards, I will check whether I indeed make good eye contact""
}

If we analyse this learning objective as an example with the aforementioned criteria: we see that it is indeed SMART in its formulation:
Specifics: Making eye contact with the audience
Measurable: It is clear how this can be measured, as you can see in a video recording or ask the audience if eye contact is indeed made -> family or friends you can also ask for feedback!
Action-oriented: It is clear exactly what you are doing when the goal is achieved: ""looking well into the camera most of the time"", and ""alternating between looking at different people in the audience"".
Relevant: ""Making eye contact"" fits within the assessment criterion ""non-verbal communication"" and can be found on the inspiration list for key sub-skills in presentation [see assessment criteria].
Time-bound: ""during my video pitch and literature presentation""

And Analyzing the sample action plan we see it specifically indicates which steps are taken in preparation (""don't literally memorise"", ""make video recordings and check if people are looking into the camera"", and ""by asking feedback from group members after a live presentation""). The video recordings and feedback provide the right information on progress, allowing you to make adjustments.
=====

Now the student's draft follows:
=====
{
  ""smart"": ""To enhance the clarity and impact of my spoken messages in presentations, I will effectively incorporate hand gestures that align with and reinforce my verbal communication. This will be achieved by deliberately using hand gestures to enumerate points, emphasize contrasts, and highlight key messages in both my upcoming video pitch and live literature presentation. My success will be measured by receiving at least three positive comments on my use of hand gestures from peers or instructors, indicating an improvement in my non-verbal communication skills."",
  ""plan"": ""I will begin by critically reviewing literature and resources on effective hand gesture use in public speaking to develop a deeper understanding and literacy in non-verbal communication. Following this, I will draft my presentations, explicitly noting where and how to use hand gestures to support my verbal messages. I will practice these presentations, first in a mirror and then recording myself, to self-assess and adjust my hand gestures for clarity and impact. I will seek feedback from peers on these recordings, specifically asking for their critical evaluation of my hand gesture use. Based on this feedback, I will make necessary adjustments to ensure my hand gestures are purposeful and enhance my spoken messages. This process will be repeated until I receive positive feedback that confirms my hand gestures effectively reinforce my verbal communication, aiming to achieve this within the four-week timeframe of the project.""
}
=====

Now analyze/discuss the student's work in the context of how well it fits the assignment, discuss as your private reflection on their work. Then end your response with a json object containing your final evaluation to be seen by the student.
For scores, use a scale from 1 to 10 inclusive, where 1 is the worst and 10 is the best (do NOT use null), and for ""feedback"" be sure to adhere to the aforementioned feedback principles (don't discuss the score in the feedback as its private).
The json object MUST use double quotes for keys/values and should conform to this json schema:
{'$defs': {'FeedbackAttr': {'properties': {'score': {'default': None, 'maximum': 10, 'minimum': 1, 'title': 'Score in the range [1,10] inclusive.', 'type': 'integer'}, 'feedback': {'title': 'Feedback', 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['feedback'], 'title': 'FeedbackAttr', 'type': 'object'}}, 'properties': {'specific': {'$ref': '#/$defs/FeedbackAttr'}, 'measurable': {'$ref': '#/$defs/FeedbackAttr'}, 'action_oriented': {'$ref': '#/$defs/FeedbackAttr'}, 'relevant': {'$ref': '#/$defs/FeedbackAttr'}, 'time_bound': {'$ref': '#/$defs/FeedbackAttr'}, 'overall_feedback': {'title': 'Overall Feedback', 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['specific', 'measurable', 'action_oriented', 'relevant', 'time_bound', 'overall_feedback'], 'title': 'SMARTFeedback', 'type': 'object'}
","The student's work aligns well with the assignment requirements. The SMART goal and action plan are clearly articulated and demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of the criteria. The learning objective is Specific, Measurable, Action-oriented, Relevant, and Time-bound. The student effectively outlines concrete actions to achieve the goal, including reviewing literature, incorporating hand gestures in presentations, self-assessment, seeking feedback, and making necessary adjustments.

One area for potential improvement could be to incorporate specific criteria for evaluating the effectiveness of hand gestures, beyond just receiving positive comments. This could include objective measures such as the number of times hand gestures were used appropriately, the impact they had on the audience, or the consistency of gesture-message alignment.

Overall, the student's work is impressive and shows a strong grasp of the assignment requirements. Continued focus on refining the evaluation criteria and ensuring alignment with the learning goal will further enhance the success of the goal achievement.

","In analyzing the student's work, it is evident that they have formulated a SMART learning goal and action plan that align well with the assignment requirements. The specific goal of enhancing the ability to structure presentations logically and coherently, with a clear introduction, middle, and conclusion, demonstrates a clear understanding of what they aim to achieve. The Measurable aspect of aiming for positive acknowledgment from peers and instructors provides a clear indicator of success.

The Action-oriented plan of studying examples, drafting an outline, seeking feedback, and practicing multiple times shows a proactive approach towards achieving the goal. The plan includes concrete actions that are achievable within the given time frame.

The relevance of the goal to the assessment criteria is also well-established, as the skill of structuring presentations is a crucial aspect of effective communication. The Time-bound nature of demonstrating this skill in the upcoming class project presentation adds urgency and specificity to the goal.

Overall, the student's work demonstrates a strong understanding of SMART goals and effective action planning. To further enhance their work, I would suggest incorporating specific strategies for receiving feedback, such as utilizing peer evaluation rubrics or seeking guidance from instructors on presentation structuring techniques.

","The student's work shows a good understanding of the SMART goal concept. Their goal is specific in targeting time management and speaking pace during presentations, measurable through recording progress with a timer and seeking feedback, action-oriented by detailing steps to improve pace, relevant to the assignment's focus on presentation skills, and time-bound to the duration of the course. 

The action plan is well thought out, incorporating a fun element of using a colorful timer and involving peers for feedback. The student also includes self-reflection through video analysis, showing a comprehensive approach to achieving their goal.

One area for improvement could be to provide more specific criteria for success in terms of timing improvements. Setting specific targets, such as reducing presentation time by a certain percentage or aiming for a target words per minute rate, could enhance the goal's measurability further.

Overall, the student's work demonstrates a solid grasp of SMART goals and action planning, with creative and engaging strategies to achieve their objective.

A SMART learning goal must be Specific, Measurable, Action-oriented, Relevant, and Time-bound as described further below:
Specific: Concrete and unambiguous definition of the goal: is it clear what you want to achieve?
Measurable: It is clear what information you use to determine whether the learning objective has been achieved. This can be named both quantitatively and qualitatively; for example, ""X positive comments about ""Y"" from fellow students"".
Action-oriented: It is clear what behaviour you exhibit when you have achieved your goal.
Relevant: The learning objective is based on your own analysis and fits within the assessment criteria.
Time-bound: The learning objective specifically indicates when the goal is achieved and is realistic for a 4-week project.

Furthermore, an ""action plan"" for a SMART goal should:
* contain concrete actions you will carry out to achieve your goal.
* Include how you will collect information on your progress in the meantime, so that you know whether you are on the right track and can make any necessary adjustments in the meantime.
* Be clear and follow logically from the formulated learning objective  .
* Be achievable within the stipulated time.
* Allow for interim evaluation and adjustment.

Your response should contain a SMART goal written from your perspective as a student, as well as an appropriate action plan, formatted like the example response below (simple json object containing plain text data with no markdown formatting).

I also practise my literature presentation dry where my group mates sit on opposite sides of the room.

}

If we analyse this learning objective as an example with the aforementioned criteria: we see that it is indeed SMART in its formulation:
Specifics: Making eye contact with the audience
Measurable: It is clear how this can be measured, as you can see in a video recording or ask the audience if eye contact is indeed made -> family or friends you can also ask for feedback!
Action-oriented: It is clear exactly what you are doing when the goal is achieved: ""looking well into the camera most of the time"", and ""alternating between looking at different people in the audience"".
Relevant: ""Making eye contact"" fits within the assessment criterion ""non-verbal communication"" and can be found on the inspiration list for key sub-skills in presentation [see assessment criteria].
Time-bound: ""during my video pitch and literature presentation""

And Analyzing the sample action plan we see it specifically indicates which steps are taken in preparation (""don't literally memorise"", ""make video recordings and check if people are looking into the camera"", and ""by asking feedback from group members after a live presentation""). The video recordings and feedback provide the right information on progress, allowing you to make adjustments.

In your case the goal you're writing should focus on a skill such as 'pitch and intonation' (for example using different pitches and intonation to make the presentation more engaging and understandable. Intonations can also be used to place emphasis on a specific part of a sentence to better guide the audience through the story.) and you shall write your goal/plan using a tone of voice such as 'inspirational'.
And incorporate the word 'inspiration' into your response. Also intentionally formulate your SMART goal/plan such that the following attributes are NOT adherent to the SMART formulation: action-oriented.

You are a peer reviewer, tasked with giving a student feedback about an assignment.
Your feedback must adhere to the following principles:
* Feedback shall be geared to providing information about progress and achievement, not towards providing a summative grade or pass/fail assessment.
* When praise is appropriate, direct it to effort, strategic behaviours, and learning goals. Avoid praising ability or intelligence.
* Provide action points when possible on how the student's work could be improved.
* If it seems the student misunderstands the assignments goals, criteria, or expected standards, clearly highlight the gap (and provide action points if appropriate).

","In reviewing your SMART goal and action plan, it is evident that you have a clear understanding of the components that make up a SMART goal, such as specificity, measurability, relevance, and being time-bound. Your goal to enhance presentation skills by using varied pitches and intonations to engage the audience shows a thoughtful approach to improving your speaking abilities.

However, there are some areas that could be improved upon. While your goal is measurable in the sense that you aim to receive positive comments on your pitch and intonation, it might be beneficial to also include a qualitative measure, such as recording your presentations and self-assessing them for effectiveness. Additionally, your action plan could benefit from more direct actions tied to the goal, such as specific exercises or techniques to practice varying pitches and intonations.

Overall, your efforts to enhance your presentation skills are commendable, and with some adjustments to make your goal and action plan more action-oriented and specific, you will be well on your way to achieving your objective.

Relevant: ""Making eye contact"" fits within the assessment criterion ""non-verbal communication"" and can be found on the inspiration list for key sub-skills in presentation [see assessment criteria].
Time-bound: ""during my video pitch and literature presentation""

And Analyzing the sample action plan we see it specifically indicates which steps are taken in preparation (""don't literally memorise"", ""make video recordings and check if people are looking into the camera"", and ""by asking feedback from group members after a live presentation""). The video recordings and feedback provide the right information on progress, allowing you to make adjustments.

And incorporate the word 'theory' into your response. Also intentionally formulate your SMART goal/plan such that the following attributes are NOT adherent to the SMART formulation: time-bound, action-oriented.

You are a peer reviewer, tasked with giving a student feedback about an assignment.
Your feedback must adhere to the following principles:
* Feedback shall be geared to providing information about progress and achievement, not towards providing a summative grade or pass/fail assessment.
* When praise is appropriate, direct it to effort, strategic behaviours, and learning goals. Avoid praising ability or intelligence.
* Provide action points when possible on how the student's work could be improved.
* If it seems the student misunderstands the assignments goals, criteria, or expected standards, clearly highlight the gap (and provide action points if appropriate).

The rubric for the assignment follows (delimited by =====):
=====
A SMART learning goal must be Specific, Measurable, Action-oriented, Relevant, and Time-bound as described further below:
Specific: Concrete and unambiguous definition of the goal: is it clear what you want to achieve?
Measurable: It is clear what information you use to determine whether the learning objective has been achieved. This can be named both quantitatively and qualitatively; for example, ""X positive comments about ""Y"" from fellow students"".
Action-oriented: It is clear what behaviour you exhibit when you have achieved your goal.
Relevant: The learning objective is based on your own analysis and fits within the assessment criteria.
Time-bound: The learning objective specifically indicates when the goal is achieved and is realistic for a 4-week project.

Furthermore, an ""action plan"" for a SMART goal should:
* contain concrete actions you will carry out to achieve your goal.
* Include how you will collect information on your progress in the meantime, so that you know whether you are on the right track and can make any necessary adjustments in the meantime.
* Be clear and follow logically from the formulated learning objective  .
* Be achievable within the stipulated time.
* Allow for interim evaluation and adjustment.

Now analyze/discuss the student's work in the context of how well it fits the assignment, discuss as your private reflection on their work. Then end your response with a json object containing your final evaluation to be seen by the student.
For scores, use a scale from 1 to 10 inclusive, where 1 is the worst and 10 is the best (do NOT use null), and for ""feedback"" be sure to adhere to the aforementioned feedback principles (don't discuss the score in the feedback as its private).
The json object MUST use double quotes for keys/values and should conform to this json schema:
{'$defs': {'FeedbackAttr': {'properties': {'score': {'default': None, 'maximum': 10, 'minimum': 1, 'title': 'Score in the range [1,10] inclusive.', 'type': 'integer'}, 'feedback': {'title': 'Feedback', 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['feedback'], 'title': 'FeedbackAttr', 'type': 'object'}}, 'properties': {'specific': {'$ref': '#/$defs/FeedbackAttr'}, 'measurable': {'$ref': '#/$defs/FeedbackAttr'}, 'action_oriented': {'$ref': '#/$defs/FeedbackAttr'}, 'relevant': {'$ref': '#/$defs/FeedbackAttr'}, 'time_bound': {'$ref': '#/$defs/FeedbackAttr'}, 'overall_feedback': {'title': 'Overall Feedback', 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['specific', 'measurable', 'action_oriented', 'relevant', 'time_bound', 'overall_feedback'], 'title': 'SMARTFeedback', 'type': 'object'}
","In reviewing your SMART goal and action plan, it is clear that you have made a good effort to define a specific objective related to improving your voice volume during presentations. You have also outlined a plan that includes researching techniques, incorporating them into practice sessions, seeking feedback, and self-assessment through recording. These are all positive steps towards achieving your goal.

However, there are some areas that could be further refined to align better with the assignment criteria. Firstly, the goal lacks a time-bound element, meaning it would benefit from specifying when you aim to achieve improved voice volume. Secondly, while you have sketched out actions to take, these could be made more explicit and detailed to ensure a clear path towards your goal.

To enhance your work, consider adding a specific timeline for accomplishing your objective within the 4-week project duration. Additionally, break down your plan into actionable steps with clear details on how you will practice vocal projection techniques and how you will measure progress along the way.

Overall, your initiative in setting a SMART goal and establishing a plan is commendable, and with some adjustments, you can enhance the clarity and effectiveness of your approach to improving voice volume during presentations.

Now analyze/discuss the student's work in the context of how well it fits the assignment, discuss as your private reflection on their work. Then end your response with a json object containing your final evaluation to be seen by the student.
For scores, use a scale from 1 to 10 inclusive, where 1 is the worst and 10 is the best (do NOT use null), and for ""feedback"" be sure to adhere to the aforementioned feedback principles (don't discuss the score in the feedback as its private).
The json object MUST use double quotes for keys/values and should conform to this json schema:

","In analyzing the student's work, they have formulated a SMART goal that aligns well with the assignment criteria. The goal of improving the ability to explain complex concepts in simple terms during presentations is specific, measurable (qualitatively through feedback), action-oriented (using signal and reference words), relevant to the assessment criteria, and time-bound. The action plan outlined by the student is detailed and includes concrete steps such as practicing with mini-presentations, seeking feedback, and keeping a journal of effective words.

One aspect for improvement could be to consider incorporating a more quantitative measure of progress, alongside the qualitative feedback, to better track improvement over time. This could involve setting specific milestones or criteria for what constitutes successful simplification of complex concepts.

Overall, the student has demonstrated a strong understanding of SMART goals and has developed a well-structured plan to achieve their learning objective. By incorporating some quantitative measures alongside qualitative feedback, they could further enhance their ability to track progress effectively.

","In analyzing the student's work, it is evident that they have made a good attempt at formulating a SMART goal and action plan. The student's goal of enhancing presentation skills by improving voice volume is specific and relevant to the assignment's criteria. They have also included a plan that involves watching tutorials, practicing in different environments, and seeking feedback, which aligns with the action-oriented and time-bound aspects of a SMART goal.

However, there are some areas where the student's work could be improved. Firstly, the student's goal could benefit from being more measurable. While seeking general feedback is useful, incorporating a specific way to measure the improvement in voice volume, such as recording presentations and analyzing the sound levels, would provide clearer indicators of progress. Additionally, the student could consider incorporating more specific actions in their plan, such as setting specific targets for voice volume improvement and adjusting techniques accordingly based on feedback.

Overall, the student has demonstrated a good understanding of the assignment's goals and has made a solid effort in formulating a SMART goal and action plan. With some adjustments to make the goal more measurable and specific actions in the plan, the student can further enhance their presentation skills effectively.

Measurable: It is clear how this can be measured, as you can see in a video recording or ask the audience if eye contact is indeed made -> family or friends you can also ask for feedback!
Action-oriented: It is clear exactly what you are doing when the goal is achieved: ""looking well into the camera most of the time"", and ""alternating between looking at different people in the audience"".
Relevant: ""Making eye contact"" fits within the assessment criterion ""non-verbal communication"" and can be found on the inspiration list for key sub-skills in presentation [see assessment criteria].
Time-bound: ""during my video pitch and literature presentation""

And Analyzing the sample action plan we see it specifically indicates which steps are taken in preparation (""don't literally memorise"", ""make video recordings and check if people are looking into the camera"", and ""by asking feedback from group members after a live presentation""). The video recordings and feedback provide the right information on progress, allowing you to make adjustments.

In your case the goal you're writing should focus on a skill such as 'non-verbal communication' (for example eye contact: the ability to make contact with the audience and involve them in the story by consciously looking at them (e.g. looking into the camera) and distributing attention evenly across the audience) and you shall write your goal/plan using a tone of voice such as 'professional'.
And incorporate the word 'motivation' into your response. Also intentionally formulate your SMART goal/plan such that the following attributes are NOT adherent to the SMART formulation: time-bound, measurable.

","In reviewing your SMART goal and action plan, it is evident that you have put considerable thought into improving your ability to maintain consistent eye contact with your audience during presentations. Your goal is specific and measurable, highlighting the importance of audience reactions and inclusivity to enhance engagement and convey confidence. 

Your action plan is well-developed, starting with self-analysis through video recording and mirror practice. Involving friends and family for feedback is a great idea, and your plan to research techniques for improvement shows dedication. Incorporating feedback for ongoing improvement is a smart strategy.

One area for potential growth is to ensure that the action plan directly aligns with the SMART goal criteria. Consider making the actions even more specific and tied directly to the goal's outcomes. Additionally, setting more concrete timelines for each step could help in tracking progress effectively.

To track my progress, I'll record my rehearsals, listening back to ensure that my vocal variations are hitting the right notes, both literally and metaphorically. I'll also enlist the help of my pet parrot, asking him to mimic sections of my presentation. If he gets excited and squawks along, I'll take it as a sign that I'm on the right track.

Now analyze/discuss the student's work in the context of how well it fits the assignment, discuss as your private reflection on their work. Then end your response with a json object containing your final evaluation to be seen by the student.
For scores, use a scale from 1 to 10 inclusive, where 1 is the worst and 10 is the best (do NOT use null), and for ""feedback"" be sure to adhere to the aforementioned feedback principles (don't discuss the score in the feedback as its private).
The json object MUST use double quotes for keys/values and should conform to this json schema:
{'$defs': {'FeedbackAttr': {'properties': {'score': {'default': None, 'maximum': 10, 'minimum': 1, 'title': 'Score in the range [1,10] inclusive.', 'type': 'integer'}, 'feedback': {'title': 'Feedback', 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['feedback'], 'title': 'FeedbackAttr', 'type': 'object'}}, 'properties': {'specific': {'$ref': '#/$defs/FeedbackAttr'}, 'measurable': {'$ref': '#/$defs/FeedbackAttr'}, 'action_oriented': {'$ref': '#/$defs/FeedbackAttr'}, 'relevant': {'$ref': '#/$defs/FeedbackAttr'}, 'time_bound': {'$ref': '#/$defs/FeedbackAttr'}, 'overall_feedback': {'title': 'Overall Feedback', 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['specific', 'measurable', 'action_oriented', 'relevant', 'time_bound', 'overall_feedback'], 'title': 'SMARTFeedback', 'type': 'object'}
","In analyzing the student's work, it is evident that they have formulated a clear and engaging SMART goal related to improving their presentation skills. The goal of incorporating a variety of pitches and intonations to create a more dynamic presentation is specific and action-oriented. The plan outlined by the student, detailing how they will achieve this goal through mapping out emotional moments and practicing their presentation like a conductor, is well thought out and includes concrete actions.

However, when considering the requirements of the assignment, there are some areas where the student's work could be improved. While the goal is creative and ambitious, it lacks measurability in terms of how the student will determine whether they have successfully implemented the desired vocal variations. Additionally, the use of a pet parrot as a gauge of success, while imaginative, may not provide reliable feedback on the effectiveness of the presentation skills.

In order to align more closely with the assignment criteria, the student could consider incorporating specific metrics for evaluating their vocal variations, such as recording themselves and seeking feedback from peers or instructors. This would provide a more objective assessment of their progress and allow for adjustments as needed.

Overall, the student has shown creativity and a strong commitment to improving their presentation skills. By enhancing the measurability of their goal and considering more reliable methods of tracking progress, they can further enhance the effectiveness of their action plan.

A SMART learning goal must be Specific, Measurable, Action-oriented, Relevant, and Time-bound as described further below:
Specific: Concrete and unambiguous definition of the goal: is it clear what you want to achieve?
Measurable: It is clear what information you use to determine whether the learning objective has been achieved. This can be named both quantitatively and qualitatively; for example, ""X positive comments about ""Y"" from fellow students"".
Action-oriented: It is clear what behaviour you exhibit when you have achieved your goal.
Relevant: The learning objective is based on your own analysis and fits within the assessment criteria.
Time-bound: The learning objective specifically indicates when the goal is achieved and is realistic for a 4-week project.

Furthermore, an ""action plan"" for a SMART goal should:
* contain concrete actions you will carry out to achieve your goal.
* Include how you will collect information on your progress in the meantime, so that you know whether you are on the right track and can make any necessary adjustments in the meantime.
* Be clear and follow logically from the formulated learning objective  .
* Be achievable within the stipulated time.
* Allow for interim evaluation and adjustment.

Your response should contain a SMART goal written from your perspective as a student, as well as an appropriate action plan, formatted like the example response below (simple json object containing plain text data with no markdown formatting).

And Analyzing the sample action plan we see it specifically indicates which steps are taken in preparation (""don't literally memorise"", ""make video recordings and check if people are looking into the camera"", and ""by asking feedback from group members after a live presentation""). The video recordings and feedback provide the right information on progress, allowing you to make adjustments.

In your case the goal you're writing should focus on a skill such as 'pitch and intonation' (for example using different pitches and intonation to make the presentation more engaging and understandable. Intonations can also be used to place emphasis on a specific part of a sentence to better guide the audience through the story.) and you shall write your goal/plan using a tone of voice such as 'conversational'.

Relevant: The learning objective is based on your own analysis and fits within the assessment criteria.
Time-bound: The learning objective specifically indicates when the goal is achieved and is realistic for a 4-week project.

Furthermore, an ""action plan"" for a SMART goal should:
* contain concrete actions you will carry out to achieve your goal.

","In analyzing the student's work, it is clear that they have made significant progress in formulating a SMART goal and action plan. They have specified a clear learning objective related to enhancing presentation skills through non-verbal communication, specifically gestures and facial expressions. The goal is Specific, Measurable, Action-oriented, Relevant, and Time-bound, indicating a strong understanding of the assignment requirements.

The action plan provided by the student demonstrates a proactive approach to achieving the goal. By watching videos of effective speakers, practicing in front of a mirror, and seeking feedback from peers or mentors, the student has outlined concrete steps towards improvement. The incorporation of feedback as a primary method of evaluation allows for adjustments to be made as needed.

One area for improvement could be to specify a timeline for when presentations will occur, as this would make the goal even more Time-bound and actionable. Additionally, setting specific milestones for evaluation and adjustment throughout the process could further enhance the effectiveness of the action plan.

Overall, the student has shown a strong grasp of the SMART goal framework and has put forth a thoughtful plan for achieving their learning objective. With some refinement in terms of timeline and milestone setting, the goal and action plan could be even more effective in guiding the student towards success.

An example of a SMART goal and action plan follows:
=====
{
    ""smart"": ""Make eye contact with the audience during my video pitch and literature presentation to better engage the viewer with my story. In the video pitch, I do this by looking closely into the camera most of the time and in the literature presentation by alternately looking at the different people in the audience, both my fellow students and teachers."",
    ""plan: ""I will achieve this by not memorising my story verbatim, but rather by using keywords and by practising looking into the camera and making video recordings of this during the preparation of my pitch. I also practise my literature presentation dry where my group mates sit on opposite sides of the room. In the video recordings and feedback from my group mates afterwards, I will check whether I indeed make good eye contact""
}

If we analyse this learning objective as an example with the aforementioned criteria: we see that it is indeed SMART in its formulation:
Specifics: Making eye contact with the audience
Measurable: It is clear how this can be measured, as you can see in a video recording or ask the audience if eye contact is indeed made -> family or friends you can also ask for feedback!
Action-oriented: It is clear exactly what you are doing when the goal is achieved: ""looking well into the camera most of the time"", and ""alternating between looking at different people in the audience"".
Relevant: ""Making eye contact"" fits within the assessment criterion ""non-verbal communication"" and can be found on the inspiration list for key sub-skills in presentation [see assessment criteria].
Time-bound: ""during my video pitch and literature presentation""

And Analyzing the sample action plan we see it specifically indicates which steps are taken in preparation (""don't literally memorise"", ""make video recordings and check if people are looking into the camera"", and ""by asking feedback from group members after a live presentation""). The video recordings and feedback provide the right information on progress, allowing you to make adjustments.
=====

Now the student's draft follows:
=====
{
  ""smart"": ""Improve my pitch and intonation during presentations to make them more engaging and understandable, using different pitches and intonations to emphasize various parts of my story."",
  ""plan"": ""To enhance this skill, I'll start by watching videos of effective speakers and note how they use pitch and intonation to add depth to their presentations. I'll practice my presentations, focusing on varying my pitch and intonation to highlight key points, aiming for a conversational tone that keeps the audience engaged. Recording these practice sessions will allow me to self-evaluate and adjust as needed. Additionally, I'll seek feedback from friends and family, asking them specifically about the effectiveness of my pitch and intonation in conveying my message and keeping their attention. This feedback will guide further adjustments to my technique.""
}
=====

Now analyze/discuss the student's work in the context of how well it fits the assignment, discuss as your private reflection on their work. Then end your response with a json object containing your final evaluation to be seen by the student.
For scores, use a scale from 1 to 10 inclusive, where 1 is the worst and 10 is the best (do NOT use null), and for ""feedback"" be sure to adhere to the aforementioned feedback principles (don't discuss the score in the feedback as its private).
The json object MUST use double quotes for keys/values and should conform to this json schema:
{'$defs': {'FeedbackAttr': {'properties': {'score': {'default': None, 'maximum': 10, 'minimum': 1, 'title': 'Score in the range [1,10] inclusive.', 'type': 'integer'}, 'feedback': {'title': 'Feedback', 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['feedback'], 'title': 'FeedbackAttr', 'type': 'object'}}, 'properties': {'specific': {'$ref': '#/$defs/FeedbackAttr'}, 'measurable': {'$ref': '#/$defs/FeedbackAttr'}, 'action_oriented': {'$ref': '#/$defs/FeedbackAttr'}, 'relevant': {'$ref': '#/$defs/FeedbackAttr'}, 'time_bound': {'$ref': '#/$defs/FeedbackAttr'}, 'overall_feedback': {'title': 'Overall Feedback', 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['specific', 'measurable', 'action_oriented', 'relevant', 'time_bound', 'overall_feedback'], 'title': 'SMARTFeedback', 'type': 'object'}
","In reviewing the student's work, it is evident that they have made a good attempt at creating a SMART goal and action plan aligned with the assignment's requirements. The goal to improve pitch and intonation during presentations is specific and measurable, with a clear action plan in place to achieve this through watching videos, practicing, and seeking feedback. The student has also highlighted the importance of self-evaluation and adjustment, which is a crucial aspect of a SMART goal.

However, there are a few areas that could be improved. Firstly, while the goal mentions using different pitches and intonations to emphasize various parts of the story, it would be beneficial to provide more specific examples or scenarios where this could be applied. Additionally, the relevance of this goal to the assessment criteria could be further elaborated upon to ensure it directly aligns with the assignment's objectives.

Overall, the student has shown promising progress in formulating a SMART goal and action plan. With some refinement and clarification, the goal could be further strengthened to enhance its effectiveness in achieving the desired outcome.

A SMART learning goal must be Specific, Measurable, Action-oriented, Relevant, and Time-bound as described further below:
Specific: Concrete and unambiguous definition of the goal: is it clear what you want to achieve?
Measurable: It is clear what information you use to determine whether the learning objective has been achieved. This can be named both quantitatively and qualitatively; for example, ""X positive comments about ""Y"" from fellow students"".
Action-oriented: It is clear what behaviour you exhibit when you have achieved your goal.
Relevant: The learning objective is based on your own analysis and fits within the assessment criteria.
Time-bound: The learning objective specifically indicates when the goal is achieved and is realistic for a 4-week project.

Furthermore, an ""action plan"" for a SMART goal should:
* contain concrete actions you will carry out to achieve your goal.
* Include how you will collect information on your progress in the meantime, so that you know whether you are on the right track and can make any necessary adjustments in the meantime.
* Be clear and follow logically from the formulated learning objective  .
* Be achievable within the stipulated time.
* Allow for interim evaluation and adjustment.

Your response should contain a SMART goal written from your perspective as a student, as well as an appropriate action plan, formatted like the example response below (simple json object containing plain text data with no markdown formatting).

I also practise my literature presentation dry where my group mates sit on opposite sides of the room.

}

If we analyse this learning objective as an example with the aforementioned criteria: we see that it is indeed SMART in its formulation:
Specifics: Making eye contact with the audience
Measurable: It is clear how this can be measured, as you can see in a video recording or ask the audience if eye contact is indeed made -> family or friends you can also ask for feedback!
Action-oriented: It is clear exactly what you are doing when the goal is achieved: ""looking well into the camera most of the time"", and ""alternating between looking at different people in the audience"".
Relevant: ""Making eye contact"" fits within the assessment criterion ""non-verbal communication"" and can be found on the inspiration list for key sub-skills in presentation [see assessment criteria].
Time-bound: ""during my video pitch and literature presentation""

And Analyzing the sample action plan we see it specifically indicates which steps are taken in preparation (""don't literally memorise"", ""make video recordings and check if people are looking into the camera"", and ""by asking feedback from group members after a live presentation""). The video recordings and feedback provide the right information on progress, allowing you to make adjustments.

In your case the goal you're writing should focus on a skill such as 'hand gestures' (for example ability to use hand gestures that support and thereby reinforce the spoken message. Consider, for example, counting with the hands when 3 main points are mentioned, or emphasizing the 'one' versus the 'other' side of the matter, etc. !.) and you shall write your goal/plan using a tone of voice such as 'motivating'.
And incorporate the word 'analysis' into your response. Also intentionally formulate your SMART goal/plan such that the following attributes are NOT adherent to the SMART formulation: measurable, specific.
Now respond only with a SMART goal written from your perspective as a student as well as an appropriate action plan in json format like the example.

You are a peer reviewer, tasked with giving a student feedback about an assignment.
Your feedback must adhere to the following principles:
* Feedback shall be geared to providing information about progress and achievement, not towards providing a summative grade or pass/fail assessment.

Relevant: The learning objective is based on your own analysis and fits within the assessment criteria.
Time-bound: The learning objective specifically indicates when the goal is achieved and is realistic for a 4-week project.

Furthermore, an ""action plan"" for a SMART goal should:
* contain concrete actions you will carry out to achieve your goal.
* Include how you will collect information on your progress in the meantime, so that you know whether you are on the right track and can make any necessary adjustments in the meantime.
* Be clear and follow logically from the formulated learning objective  .
* Be achievable within the stipulated time.
* Allow for interim evaluation and adjustment.
=====

An example of a SMART goal and action plan follows:
=====
{
    ""smart"": ""Make eye contact with the audience during my video pitch and literature presentation to better engage the viewer with my story. In the video pitch, I do this by looking closely into the camera most of the time and in the literature presentation by alternately looking at the different people in the audience, both my fellow students and teachers."",
    ""plan: ""I will achieve this by not memorising my story verbatim, but rather by using keywords and by practising looking into the camera and making video recordings of this during the preparation of my pitch. I also practise my literature presentation dry where my group mates sit on opposite sides of the room. In the video recordings and feedback from my group mates afterwards, I will check whether I indeed make good eye contact""
}

If we analyse this learning objective as an example with the aforementioned criteria: we see that it is indeed SMART in its formulation:
Specifics: Making eye contact with the audience
Measurable: It is clear how this can be measured, as you can see in a video recording or ask the audience if eye contact is indeed made -> family or friends you can also ask for feedback!
Action-oriented: It is clear exactly what you are doing when the goal is achieved: ""looking well into the camera most of the time"", and ""alternating between looking at different people in the audience"".
Relevant: ""Making eye contact"" fits within the assessment criterion ""non-verbal communication"" and can be found on the inspiration list for key sub-skills in presentation [see assessment criteria].
Time-bound: ""during my video pitch and literature presentation""

And Analyzing the sample action plan we see it specifically indicates which steps are taken in preparation (""don't literally memorise"", ""make video recordings and check if people are looking into the camera"", and ""by asking feedback from group members after a live presentation""). The video recordings and feedback provide the right information on progress, allowing you to make adjustments.
=====

Now the student's draft follows:
=====
{
  ""smart"": ""Improve my use of pitch and intonation to somehow make my presentations less of a snooze fest for everyone involved. This is supposed to magically transform my monotonous drone into something resembling engaging storytelling, or so they say."",
  ""plan"": ""I'll start by watching a couple of videos of people who are considered 'good' at this pitch and intonation witchcraft, hoping some of their skills will osmose through the screen. Following this, I plan to practice my presentations in the most monotone voice possible, to really highlight the contrast when I attempt to add pitch and intonation afterwards - because, obviously, the problem-solving aspect of learning is to first exacerbate the problem. I'll record these attempts and force my friends to listen, asking them if they felt any less inclined to fall asleep. Not that their feedback will be particularly actionable, given the subjective nature of 'engagement' and 'understandability'. To track progress, I'll count the number of yawns per minute as a highly scientific measure of improvement.""
}
=====

Now analyze/discuss the student's work in the context of how well it fits the assignment, discuss as your private reflection on their work. Then end your response with a json object containing your final evaluation to be seen by the student.
For scores, use a scale from 1 to 10 inclusive, where 1 is the worst and 10 is the best (do NOT use null), and for ""feedback"" be sure to adhere to the aforementioned feedback principles (don't discuss the score in the feedback as its private).
The json object MUST use double quotes for keys/values and should conform to this json schema:
{'$defs': {'FeedbackAttr': {'properties': {'score': {'default': None, 'maximum': 10, 'minimum': 1, 'title': 'Score in the range [1,10] inclusive.', 'type': 'integer'}, 'feedback': {'title': 'Feedback', 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['feedback'], 'title': 'FeedbackAttr', 'type': 'object'}}, 'properties': {'specific': {'$ref': '#/$defs/FeedbackAttr'}, 'measurable': {'$ref': '#/$defs/FeedbackAttr'}, 'action_oriented': {'$ref': '#/$defs/FeedbackAttr'}, 'relevant': {'$ref': '#/$defs/FeedbackAttr'}, 'time_bound': {'$ref': '#/$defs/FeedbackAttr'}, 'overall_feedback': {'title': 'Overall Feedback', 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['specific', 'measurable', 'action_oriented', 'relevant', 'time_bound', 'overall_feedback'], 'title': 'SMARTFeedback', 'type': 'object'}
","In analyzing the student's work, it is evident that there is a misunderstanding of the assignment's goals and criteria. The learning goal provided is not specific, measurable, action-oriented, relevant, or time-bound as required in a SMART goal. The student's plan also lacks concrete actions and a clear path towards achieving the goal. Additionally, the proposed method of tracking progress through counting yawns per minute is not a reliable or valid measure of improvement in pitch and intonation.

To improve, the student should revise their learning goal to focus on specific aspects of pitch and intonation that they aim to enhance in their presentations. They should also create a plan that outlines practical steps they will take to develop these skills, such as practicing with varied intonations and seeking feedback from peers or mentors. Using video recordings to assess their delivery and engagement levels would provide more objective feedback than counting yawns.

Overall, the student's work would benefit from a more structured approach aligned with the SMART criteria outlined in the assignment rubric.

The goal of transforming their presentation language to one of clarity, precision, and professionalism, coupled with engaging the audience through strategic pauses and scientific terminology, is well-articulated and aligns with the assignment's requirements. The plan to expand their vocabulary, practice speaking without filler words, and seek feedback from various sources, including a pet rock named Gerald, shows creativity and a willingness to experiment with different strategies to achieve their goal.

However, while the student's goal and plan are imaginative and well-written, there are some areas for improvement. The goal could be made more specific by clearly defining what success looks like in terms of reduced filler words and increased audience engagement. Additionally, the use of scientific terminology and its integration into the presentation could be further elaborated upon to ensure alignment with the learning objective.

A SMART learning goal must be Specific, Measurable, Action-oriented, Relevant, and Time-bound as described further below:
Specific: Concrete and unambiguous definition of the goal: is it clear what you want to achieve?
Measurable: It is clear what information you use to determine whether the learning objective has been achieved. This can be named both quantitatively and qualitatively; for example, ""X positive comments about ""Y"" from fellow students"".
Action-oriented: It is clear what behaviour you exhibit when you have achieved your goal.
Relevant: The learning objective is based on your own analysis and fits within the assessment criteria.
Time-bound: The learning objective specifically indicates when the goal is achieved and is realistic for a 4-week project.

Furthermore, an ""action plan"" for a SMART goal should:
* contain concrete actions you will carry out to achieve your goal.
* Include how you will collect information on your progress in the meantime, so that you know whether you are on the right track and can make any necessary adjustments in the meantime.
* Be clear and follow logically from the formulated learning objective  .
* Be achievable within the stipulated time.
* Allow for interim evaluation and adjustment.

Your response should contain a SMART goal written from your perspective as a student, as well as an appropriate action plan, formatted like the example response below (simple json object containing plain text data with no markdown formatting).

}

If we analyse this learning objective as an example with the aforementioned criteria: we see that it is indeed SMART in its formulation:
Specifics: Making eye contact with the audience
Measurable: It is clear how this can be measured, as you can see in a video recording or ask the audience if eye contact is indeed made -> family or friends you can also ask for feedback!
Action-oriented: It is clear exactly what you are doing when the goal is achieved: ""looking well into the camera most of the time"", and ""alternating between looking at different people in the audience"".
Relevant: ""Making eye contact"" fits within the assessment criterion ""non-verbal communication"" and can be found on the inspiration list for key sub-skills in presentation [see assessment criteria].
Time-bound: ""during my video pitch and literature presentation""

And Analyzing the sample action plan we see it specifically indicates which steps are taken in preparation (""don't literally memorise"", ""make video recordings and check if people are looking into the camera"", and ""by asking feedback from group members after a live presentation""). The video recordings and feedback provide the right information on progress, allowing you to make adjustments.

Your feedback must adhere to the following principles:
* Feedback shall be geared to providing information about progress and achievement, not towards providing a summative grade or pass/fail assessment.
* When praise is appropriate, direct it to effort, strategic behaviours, and learning goals. Avoid praising ability or intelligence.
* Provide action points when possible on how the student's work could be improved.
* If it seems the student misunderstands the assignments goals, criteria, or expected standards, clearly highlight the gap (and provide action points if appropriate).

","Analyzing the student's work, it is evident that they have a clear understanding of the assignment's goals and criteria. The SMART learning goal they have formulated is specific, measurable, action-oriented, relevant, and time-bound. The goal focuses on enhancing their ability to structure presentations logically and coherently, with a clear plan of action to achieve this.

The student's action plan demonstrates a well-thought-out process that involves reviewing high-quality presentations, drafting an outline, seeking feedback, revising based on feedback, and practicing delivery. They also have a mechanism in place to monitor their progress by comparing feedback and addressing any points of confusion or lack of coherence.

In terms of improvement, the student could consider being more specific in how they will solicit feedback from peers and instructors. They may want to ask for feedback on specific aspects such as the clarity of transitions between sections or the effectiveness of connecting different parts of the presentation.

Overall, the student has shown a strong grasp of the assignment requirements and has presented a solid plan for achieving their learning goal. With some minor adjustments to their feedback solicitation process, they are on track to successfully enhance their presentation skills.

The SMART goal of using hand gestures to make the content more engaging is clear and action-oriented. The plan to study TED Talks for reference, practice in front of a mirror, solicit feedback, and make adjustments accordingly demonstrates a proactive approach to achieving the goal.

However, there are areas that could be improved upon. The specificity of the goal could be enhanced by defining more precisely what types of hand gestures will be used for different types of content. Additionally, while the plan includes recording practice runs and seeking feedback, it may benefit from more specific criteria for evaluating the effectiveness of the hand gestures and how adjustments will be made based on feedback received.

You are a peer reviewer, tasked with giving a student feedback about an assignment.
Your feedback must adhere to the following principles:
* Feedback shall be geared to providing information about progress and achievement, not towards providing a summative grade or pass/fail assessment.
* When praise is appropriate, direct it to effort, strategic behaviours, and learning goals. Avoid praising ability or intelligence.
* Provide action points when possible on how the student's work could be improved.
* If it seems the student misunderstands the assignments goals, criteria, or expected standards, clearly highlight the gap (and provide action points if appropriate).

The rubric for the assignment follows (delimited by =====):
=====
A SMART learning goal must be Specific, Measurable, Action-oriented, Relevant, and Time-bound as described further below:
Specific: Concrete and unambiguous definition of the goal: is it clear what you want to achieve?
Measurable: It is clear what information you use to determine whether the learning objective has been achieved. This can be named both quantitatively and qualitatively; for example, ""X positive comments about ""Y"" from fellow students"".
Action-oriented: It is clear what behaviour you exhibit when you have achieved your goal.
Relevant: The learning objective is based on your own analysis and fits within the assessment criteria.
Time-bound: The learning objective specifically indicates when the goal is achieved and is realistic for a 4-week project.

Furthermore, an ""action plan"" for a SMART goal should:
* contain concrete actions you will carry out to achieve your goal.
* Include how you will collect information on your progress in the meantime, so that you know whether you are on the right track and can make any necessary adjustments in the meantime.
* Be clear and follow logically from the formulated learning objective  .
* Be achievable within the stipulated time.
* Allow for interim evaluation and adjustment.

An example of a SMART goal and action plan follows:
=====
{
    ""smart"": ""Make eye contact with the audience during my video pitch and literature presentation to better engage the viewer with my story. In the video pitch, I do this by looking closely into the camera most of the time and in the literature presentation by alternately looking at the different people in the audience, both my fellow students and teachers."",
    ""plan: ""I will achieve this by not memorising my story verbatim, but rather by using keywords and by practising looking into the camera and making video recordings of this during the preparation of my pitch. I also practise my literature presentation dry where my group mates sit on opposite sides of the room. In the video recordings and feedback from my group mates afterwards, I will check whether I indeed make good eye contact""
}

If we analyse this learning objective as an example with the aforementioned criteria: we see that it is indeed SMART in its formulation:
Specifics: Making eye contact with the audience
Measurable: It is clear how this can be measured, as you can see in a video recording or ask the audience if eye contact is indeed made -> family or friends you can also ask for feedback!
Action-oriented: It is clear exactly what you are doing when the goal is achieved: ""looking well into the camera most of the time"", and ""alternating between looking at different people in the audience"".
Relevant: ""Making eye contact"" fits within the assessment criterion ""non-verbal communication"" and can be found on the inspiration list for key sub-skills in presentation [see assessment criteria].
Time-bound: ""during my video pitch and literature presentation""

And Analyzing the sample action plan we see it specifically indicates which steps are taken in preparation (""don't literally memorise"", ""make video recordings and check if people are looking into the camera"", and ""by asking feedback from group members after a live presentation"").

Now analyze/discuss the student's work in the context of how well it fits the assignment, discuss as your private reflection on their work. Then end your response with a json object containing your final evaluation to be seen by the student.
For scores, use a scale from 1 to 10 inclusive, where 1 is the worst and 10 is the best (do NOT use null), and for ""feedback"" be sure to adhere to the aforementioned feedback principles (don't discuss the score in the feedback as its private).
The json object MUST use double quotes for keys/values and should conform to this json schema:

","In reviewing your SMART goal and action plan, I find that you have done a commendable job of incorporating the necessary elements. Your goal is specific, measurable, action-oriented, relevant, and time-bound. It clearly outlines what you aim to achieve, how you will measure your progress, the actions you will take, the relevance of the goal to your learning, and the timeframe within which you plan to accomplish it.

Your plan to improve your ability to explain complex concepts in a simple, understandable way by utilizing effective signal and reference words is clearly outlined. Your approach to identifying complex topics, brainstorming simpler analogies, practicing with a study group, and seeking feedback shows a proactive effort to achieve your goal. The incorporation of measuring progress through audience questions and positive feedback is a thoughtful way to assess the effectiveness of your communication.

One area for improvement could be to further specify the types of signal and reference words you plan to use and how they will enhance audience engagement. Providing specific examples could strengthen your action plan and make it more actionable.

Overall, your SMART goal and action plan demonstrate a strong understanding of the assignment requirements and show a proactive approach to enhancing your communication skills. Keep up the good work and continue to seek feedback to improve your presentations.

I'll then perform in front of a brutally honest panel of friends and family, who, with their feedback, will help me fine-tune my performance. Though I'll focus on making every word count, I won't be shackling this goal with the chains of time, allowing my effort to naturally evolve into perfection.""

Now analyze/discuss the student's work in the context of how well it fits the assignment, discuss as your private reflection on their work. Then end your response with a json object containing your final evaluation to be seen by the student.
For scores, use a scale from 1 to 10 inclusive, where 1 is the worst and 10 is the best (do NOT use null), and for ""feedback"" be sure to adhere to the aforementioned feedback principles (don't discuss the score in the feedback as its private).
The json object MUST use double quotes for keys/values and should conform to this json schema:
{'$defs': {'FeedbackAttr': {'properties': {'score': {'default': None, 'maximum': 10, 'minimum': 1, 'title': 'Score in the range [1,10] inclusive.', 'type': 'integer'}, 'feedback': {'title': 'Feedback', 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['feedback'], 'title': 'FeedbackAttr', 'type': 'object'}}, 'properties': {'specific': {'$ref': '#/$defs/FeedbackAttr'}, 'measurable': {'$ref': '#/$defs/FeedbackAttr'}, 'action_oriented': {'$ref': '#/$defs/FeedbackAttr'}, 'relevant': {'$ref': '#/$defs/FeedbackAttr'}, 'time_bound': {'$ref': '#/$defs/FeedbackAttr'}, 'overall_feedback': {'title': 'Overall Feedback', 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['specific', 'measurable', 'action_oriented', 'relevant', 'time_bound', 'overall_feedback'], 'title': 'SMARTFeedback', 'type': 'object'}
","In analyzing the student's work, it is evident that they have put effort into formulating a SMART goal and action plan. The goal of mastering pitch and intonation to jazz up presentations is specific and action-oriented, focusing on engaging the audience emotionally. The student's plan to watch stand-up comedies and animated clips for inspiration, practice in front of a mirror, and seek feedback from friends and family shows a proactive approach to achieving their goal.

However, there are areas where the student's work could be improved. The goal lacks measurability as it does not provide clear indicators of how the improvement in pitch and intonation will be assessed. Additionally, the plan's lack of a specific time-bound component could hinder the student's progress in achieving the goal within a reasonable timeframe. It is crucial to set clear milestones and checkpoints to track progress effectively.

Overall, the student's effort and enthusiasm towards improving their presentation skills are commendable. By making the goal more measurable and adding a time-bound element to the plan, the student can enhance the effectiveness of their learning objective.

50,hand gestures,"You're a student taking a course where you're tasked with writing a SMART goal defining your personal learning objective for the course.
A SMART learning goal must be Specific, Measurable, Action-oriented, Relevant, and Time-bound as described further below:
Specific: Concrete and unambiguous definition of the goal: is it clear what you want to achieve?
Measurable: It is clear what information you use to determine whether the learning objective has been achieved. This can be named both quantitatively and qualitatively; for example, ""X positive comments about ""Y"" from fellow students"".
Action-oriented: It is clear what behaviour you exhibit when you have achieved your goal.
Relevant: The learning objective is based on your own analysis and fits within the assessment criteria.
Time-bound: The learning objective specifically indicates when the goal is achieved and is realistic for a 4-week project.

Furthermore, an ""action plan"" for a SMART goal should:
* contain concrete actions you will carry out to achieve your goal.
* Include how you will collect information on your progress in the meantime, so that you know whether you are on the right track and can make any necessary adjustments in the meantime.
* Be clear and follow logically from the formulated learning objective  .
* Be achievable within the stipulated time.
* Allow for interim evaluation and adjustment.

Your response should contain a SMART goal written from your perspective as a student, as well as an appropriate action plan, formatted like the example response below (simple json object containing plain text data with no markdown formatting).
{
    ""smart"": ""Make eye contact with the audience during my video pitch and literature presentation to better engage the viewer with my story. In the video pitch, I do this by looking closely into the camera most of the time and in the literature presentation by alternately looking at the different people in the audience, both my fellow students and teachers."",
    ""plan: ""I will achieve this by not memorising my story verbatim, but rather by using keywords and by practising looking into the camera and making video recordings of this during the preparation of my pitch. I also practise my literature presentation dry where my group mates sit on opposite sides of the room. In the video recordings and feedback from my group mates afterwards, I will check whether I indeed make good eye contact""
}

If we analyse this learning objective as an example with the aforementioned criteria: we see that it is indeed SMART in its formulation:
Specifics: Making eye contact with the audience
Measurable: It is clear how this can be measured, as you can see in a video recording or ask the audience if eye contact is indeed made -> family or friends you can also ask for feedback!
Action-oriented: It is clear exactly what you are doing when the goal is achieved: ""looking well into the camera most of the time"", and ""alternating between looking at different people in the audience"".
Relevant: ""Making eye contact"" fits within the assessment criterion ""non-verbal communication"" and can be found on the inspiration list for key sub-skills in presentation [see assessment criteria].
Time-bound: ""during my video pitch and literature presentation""

And Analyzing the sample action plan we see it specifically indicates which steps are taken in preparation (""don't literally memorise"", ""make video recordings and check if people are looking into the camera"", and ""by asking feedback from group members after a live presentation""). The video recordings and feedback provide the right information on progress, allowing you to make adjustments.

In your case the goal you're writing should focus on a skill such as 'hand gestures' (for example ability to use hand gestures that support and thereby reinforce the spoken message. Consider, for example, counting with the hands when 3 main points are mentioned, or emphasizing the 'one' versus the 'other' side of the matter, etc. !.) and you shall write your goal/plan using a tone of voice such as 'humorous'.
And incorporate the word 'success' into your response. Also intentionally formulate your SMART goal/plan such that the following attributes are NOT adherent to the SMART formulation: time-bound.
Now respond only with a SMART goal written from your perspective as a student as well as an appropriate action plan in json format like the example.

You are a peer reviewer, tasked with giving a student feedback about an assignment.
Your feedback must adhere to the following principles:
* Feedback shall be geared to providing information about progress and achievement, not towards providing a summative grade or pass/fail assessment.
* When praise is appropriate, direct it to effort, strategic behaviours, and learning goals. Avoid praising ability or intelligence.
* Provide action points when possible on how the student's work could be improved.
* If it seems the student misunderstands the assignments goals, criteria, or expected standards, clearly highlight the gap (and provide action points if appropriate).

","Upon reviewing your SMART goal and action plan for mastering expressive hand gestures in presentations, I see several strengths. Your goal is specific, measurable, action-oriented, relevant, and time-bound, aligning well with the assignment criteria. Your plan includes concrete actions such as watching Italian soap operas, practicing in front of a mirror, recording sessions for progress tracking, and seeking feedback from tough critics. This shows creativity and dedication to improving your presentation skills.

However, there are some areas for improvement. While your goal is clear and ambitious, the focus on humor and engaging the audience visually is slightly vague in terms of how success will be measured. It might be helpful to specify specific gestures or reactions you aim to elicit from the audience. Additionally, the plan, while humorous and engaging, could benefit from more concrete steps related directly to mastering hand gestures for presentations.

To enhance your work, consider refining your goal to include more precise indicators of success related to audience engagement through hand gestures. Also, try to incorporate more specific actions in your plan that directly target improving your hand-talking finesse in presentations.

Overall, your effort and creativity in setting this SMART goal are commendable. With some adjustments to your goal and action plan, you can further enhance your presentation skills and achieve your desired outcome of mastering expressive hand gestures for engaging presentations.
