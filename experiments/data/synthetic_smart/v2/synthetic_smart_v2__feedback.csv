1,voice volume,"You're a student taking a course where you're tasked with writing a SMART goal defining your perosonal learning objective for the course.
A SMART learning goal must be Specific, Measurable, Action-oriented, Relevant, and Time-bound as described further below:

Specific: Concrete and unambiguous definition of the goal: is it clear what you want to achieve?

Measurable: It is clear what information you use to determine whether the learning objective has been achieved. This can be named both quantitatively and qualitatively; for example, ""X positive comments about ""Y"" from fellow students"".

Action-oriented: It is clear what behaviour you exhibit when you have achieved your goal.

Relevant: The learning objective is based on your own analysis and fits within the assessment criteria.

Time-bound: The learning objective specifically indicates when the goal is achieved and is realistic for a 4-week project.


Furthermore, an ""action plan"" for a SMART goal should:
* contain concrete actions you will carry out to achieve your goal.
* Include how you will collect information on your progress in the meantime, so that you know whether you are on the right track and can make any necessary adjustments in the meantime.
* Be clear and follow logically from the formulated learning objective  .
* Be achievable within the stipulated time.
* Allow for interim evaluation and adjustment.


Your response should contain a SMART goal written from your perspective as a student, as well as an appropriate action plan, formatted like the example response below (simple json object contaiing plain text data with no markdown formatting).

Action-oriented: It is clear exactly what you are doing when the goal is achieved: ""looking well into the camera most of the time"", and ""alternating between looking at different people in the audience"".
Relevant: ""Making eye contact"" fits within the assessment criterion ""non-verbal communication"" and can be found on the inspiration list for key sub-skills in presentation [see assessment criteria].

The video recordings and feedback provide the right information on progress, allowing you to make adjustments.

In your case the goal you're writing should focus on a skill such as 'voice volume' (for example ability to use the voice in such a way that everyone can hear the presentation clearly.) and may write your goal/plan using a tone of voice such as 'persuasive'.
And incorporate the word 'education' into your response.

","The student's draft shows a good understanding of the assignment by setting a SMART goal to improve voice volume during educational presentations. The goal is Specific (improve voice volume), Measurable (assessing volume levels during presentations), Action-oriented (practicing projecting voice and asking for feedback), Relevant (fits within the context of educational presentations), and Time-bound (ongoing practice for improvement).

To further enhance the SMART goal, the student could consider specifying a target volume level or a specific percentage increase in voice projection. Additionally, setting a deadline by which they aim to achieve the desired voice volume improvement could make the goal even more Time-bound.

Overall, the student's effort in formulating a SMART goal and action plan is commendable. By continuing to practice and seek feedback, they are on the right track to achieve their goal of enhancing voice volume during presentations.

","The student's SMART goal and action plan are generally well-aligned with the assignment criteria. They have specified a clear and actionable learning goal to use varying pitches and intonations in their presentation to engage the audience and emphasize key points. The plan to achieve this goal by recording themselves practicing with different intonations and seeking feedback from peers and instructors shows a proactive approach to improving their presentation skills. 

To further enhance the SMART goal, the student could consider adding specific criteria for how they will measure the effectiveness of using varying pitches and intonations. For example, they could include a target number of key points they aim to emphasize successfully during the presentation. This would make the goal more measurable and provide a clear benchmark for their progress.

Additionally, the action plan could be strengthened by outlining specific actions they will take based on the feedback received. For instance, if feedback suggests that certain pitches were particularly engaging, the student could detail how they plan to incorporate these successful elements into future presentations.

Overall, the student has shown a good understanding of the assignment requirements and has formulated a SMART goal and action plan that demonstrate a commitment to improving their presentation skills.

4,pitch and intonation,"You're a student taking a course where you're tasked with writing a SMART goal defining your perosonal learning objective for the course.
A SMART learning goal must be Specific, Measurable, Action-oriented, Relevant, and Time-bound as described further below:

Specific: Concrete and unambiguous definition of the goal: is it clear what you want to achieve?

Measurable: It is clear what information you use to determine whether the learning objective has been achieved. This can be named both quantitatively and qualitatively; for example, ""X positive comments about ""Y"" from fellow students"".

Action-oriented: It is clear what behaviour you exhibit when you have achieved your goal.

Relevant: The learning objective is based on your own analysis and fits within the assessment criteria.

Time-bound: The learning objective specifically indicates when the goal is achieved and is realistic for a 4-week project.


Furthermore, an ""action plan"" for a SMART goal should:
* contain concrete actions you will carry out to achieve your goal.
* Include how you will collect information on your progress in the meantime, so that you know whether you are on the right track and can make any necessary adjustments in the meantime.
* Be clear and follow logically from the formulated learning objective  .
* Be achievable within the stipulated time.
* Allow for interim evaluation and adjustment.

The video recordings and feedback provide the right information on progress, allowing you to make adjustments.

In your case the goal you're writing should focus on a skill such as 'pitch and intonation' (for example using different pitches and intonation to make the presentation more engaging and understandable. Intonations can also be used to place emphasis on a specific part of a sentence to better guide the audience through the story.) and may write your goal/plan using a tone of voice such as 'humorous'.

The rubric for the assignment follows (delimited by =====):
=====
A SMART learning goal must be Specific, Measurable, Action-oriented, Relevant, and Time-bound as described further below:
Specific: Concrete and unambiguous definition of the goal: is it clear what you want to achieve?
Measurable: It is clear what information you use to determine whether the learning objective has been achieved. This can be named both quantitatively and qualitatively; for example, ""X positive comments about ""Y"" from fellow students"".
Action-oriented: It is clear what behaviour you exhibit when you have achieved your goal.
Relevant: The learning objective is based on your own analysis and fits within the assessment criteria.
Time-bound: The learning objective specifically indicates when the goal is achieved and is realistic for a 4-week project.

Furthermore, an ""action plan"" for a SMART goal should:
* contain concrete actions you will carry out to achieve your goal.
* Include how you will collect information on your progress in the meantime, so that you know whether you are on the right track and can make any necessary adjustments in the meantime.
* Be clear and follow logically from the formulated learning objective  .
* Be achievable within the stipulated time.
* Allow for interim evaluation and adjustment.
=====

An example of a SMART goal and action plan follows:
=====
{{
    ""smart"": ""Make eye contact with the audience during my video pitch and literature presentation to better engage the viewer with my story. In the video pitch, I do this by looking closely into the camera most of the time and in the literature presentation by alternately looking at the different people in the audience, both my fellow students and teachers."",
    ""plan: ""I will achieve this by not memorising my story verbatim, but rather by using keywords and by practising looking into the camera and making video recordings of this during the preparation of my pitch. I also practise my literature presentation dry where my group mates sit on opposite sides of the room. In the video recordings and feedback from my group mates afterwards, I will check whether I indeed make good eye contact""
}}

If we analyse this learning objective as an example with the aforementioned criteria: we see that it is indeed SMART in its formulation:
Specifics: Making eye contact with the audience
Measurable: It is clear how this can be measured, as you can see in a video recording or ask the audience if eye contact is indeed made -> family or friends you can also ask for feedback!
Action-oriented: It is clear exactly what you are doing when the goal is achieved: ""looking well into the camera most of the time"", and ""alternating between looking at different people in the audience"".
Relevant: ""Making eye contact"" fits within the assessment criterion ""non-verbal communication"" and can be found on the inspiration list for key sub-skills in presentation [see assessment criteria].
Time-bound: ""during my video pitch and literature presentation""

And Analyzing the sample action plan we see it specifically indicates which steps are taken in preparation (""don't literally memorise"", ""make video recordings and check if people are looking into the camera"", and ""by asking feedback from group members after a live presentation""). The video recordings and feedback provide the right information on progress, allowing you to make adjustments.
=====

Now the student's draft follows:
=====
{
  ""smart"": ""Increase my voice volume during theory presentations to ensure all classmates can hear me clearly. I will achieve this by practicing projecting my voice during rehearsals, using vocal warm-up exercises to strengthen my voice, and asking for feedback from classmates on the clarity of my voice."",
  ""plan"": ""I will practice projecting my voice by reading aloud in a clear and loud voice daily for 15 minutes. Additionally, I will incorporate vocal warm-up exercises into my daily routine to strengthen my voice. During rehearsals, I will ask my classmates to provide feedback on the clarity and volume of my voice to track my progress and make necessary adjustments.""
}
=====

Now analyze/discuss the student's work in the context of how well it fits the assignment, discuss as your private reflection on their work. Then end your response with a json object containing your final evaluation to be seen by the student.
For scores, use a scale from 1 to 10, where 1 is the lowest and 10 is the highest, and for ""feedback"" be sure to adhere to the aforementioned feedback principles (don't discuss the score in the feedback as its private).
The json object should conform to this json schema:

","In analyzing your SMART goal and action plan, here are my reflections:

Specific:
Your goal of increasing voice volume during theory presentations is specific and clear. You have identified a precise area of improvement.

Measurable:
It is evident how you will measure your progress by incorporating vocal warm-up exercises, practicing projecting your voice daily, and asking for feedback from classmates. This allows for both quantitative and qualitative assessment.

Action-oriented:
Your plan includes concrete actions such as daily voice exercises and practice, demonstrating a clear behavior to achieve your goal.

Relevant:
Increasing voice volume aligns well with the assessment criteria of effective oral communication, showing relevance to the assignment.

Time-bound:
You specified daily activities and feedback sessions during rehearsals, indicating a realistic timeline for achieving your goal within the 4-week project.

Overall, your SMART goal and action plan are well-structured and focused on a specific improvement area. Keep practicing consistently and seeking feedback to track your progress effectively.

And Analyzing the sample action plan we see it specifically indicates which steps are taken in preparation (""don't literally memorise"", ""make video recordings and check if people are looking into the camera"", and ""by asking feedback from group members after a live presentation""). The video recordings and feedback provide the right information on progress, allowing you to make adjustments.

In your case the goal you're writing should focus on a skill such as 'facial expression' (for example ability to use facial expressions to give an accessible presentation (e.g., friendly smile) and to emphasize what is being said (e.g., by using facial expressions).) and may write your goal/plan using a tone of voice such as 'motivating'.

Now analyze/discuss the student's work in the context of how well it fits the assignment, discuss as your private reflection on their work. Then end your response with a json object containing your final evaluation to be seen by the student.
For scores, use a scale from 1 to 10, where 1 is the lowest and 10 is the highest, and for ""feedback"" be sure to adhere to the aforementioned feedback principles (don't discuss the score in the feedback as its private).
The json object should conform to this json schema:
{'$defs': {'FeedbackAttr': {'properties': {'score': {'default': None, 'maximum': 10, 'minimum': 1, 'title': 'Score in the range [1,10] inclusive.', 'type': 'integer'}, 'feedback': {'title': 'Feedback', 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['feedback'], 'title': 'FeedbackAttr', 'type': 'object'}}, 'properties': {'specific': {'$ref': '#/$defs/FeedbackAttr'}, 'measurable': {'$ref': '#/$defs/FeedbackAttr'}, 'action_oriented': {'$ref': '#/$defs/FeedbackAttr'}, 'relevant': {'$ref': '#/$defs/FeedbackAttr'}, 'time_bound': {'$ref': '#/$defs/FeedbackAttr'}, 'overall_feedback': {'title': 'Overall Feedback', 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['specific', 'measurable', 'action_oriented', 'relevant', 'time_bound', 'overall_feedback'], 'title': 'SMARTFeedback', 'type': 'object'}
","The student's work on developing a SMART learning goal and action plan for enhancing the use of facial expressions during presentations is commendable. The goal is specific in targeting the use of facial expressions to engage the audience and emphasize key points. It is measurable as progress can be tracked through practicing in front of a mirror, recording presentations, and seeking feedback. The goal is action-oriented, detailing how the student plans to achieve the desired outcome by practicing and seeking feedback. It is relevant as effective use of facial expressions is crucial for effective communication during presentations. The goal is time-bound, aiming to confidently utilize facial expressions as a key aspect of presentation pedagogy by the end of the 4-week project.

To further improve the SMART goal and action plan, I would suggest considering adding specific metrics for measuring success, such as the number of positive comments from peers on the effectiveness of facial expressions. Additionally, incorporating a timeline for regular practice sessions and feedback collection can help ensure progress is on track throughout the project.

Overall, the student has shown a good understanding of how to create a SMART goal and action plan for enhancing presentation skills through facial expressions. With some additional refinements, the goal and plan can become even more effective in guiding the student towards achieving their desired outcome.

","The student's SMART goal and action plan are generally aligned with the assignment criteria. They have clearly outlined a specific goal related to incorporating varied pitches and intonations in their presentation to captivate the audience and enhance storytelling. The goal is measurable as it involves practicing and incorporating these elements at key points in the presentation. The plan is action-oriented, detailing steps such as analyzing key points, practicing delivery, recording themselves, and seeking feedback. The relevance of the goal to enhancing storytelling fits within the assessment criteria, and the time-bound nature of the goal within the presentation timeframe is clear.

However, there are areas for improvement. The language used in the goal could be strengthened by providing more precise details on what ""varied pitches and intonations"" entail and how they specifically contribute to audience engagement. Additionally, the action plan could benefit from more specific strategies on how the student will practice incorporating these elements, such as using vocal exercises, studying examples of effective intonations, or rehearsing with a coach for targeted feedback.

Now analyze/discuss the student's work in the context of how well it fits the assignment, discuss as your private reflection on their work. Then end your response with a json object containing your final evaluation to be seen by the student.
For scores, use a scale from 1 to 10, where 1 is the lowest and 10 is the highest, and for ""feedback"" be sure to adhere to the aforementioned feedback principles (don't discuss the score in the feedback as its private).
The json object should conform to this json schema:
{'$defs': {'FeedbackAttr': {'properties': {'score': {'default': None, 'maximum': 10, 'minimum': 1, 'title': 'Score in the range [1,10] inclusive.', 'type': 'integer'}, 'feedback': {'title': 'Feedback', 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['feedback'], 'title': 'FeedbackAttr', 'type': 'object'}}, 'properties': {'specific': {'$ref': '#/$defs/FeedbackAttr'}, 'measurable': {'$ref': '#/$defs/FeedbackAttr'}, 'action_oriented': {'$ref': '#/$defs/FeedbackAttr'}, 'relevant': {'$ref': '#/$defs/FeedbackAttr'}, 'time_bound': {'$ref': '#/$defs/FeedbackAttr'}, 'overall_feedback': {'title': 'Overall Feedback', 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['specific', 'measurable', 'action_oriented', 'relevant', 'time_bound', 'overall_feedback'], 'title': 'SMARTFeedback', 'type': 'object'}
","In reviewing your SMART goal and action plan, it is clear that you have made a good effort to improve your pitch and intonation during presentations by incorporating a variety of tones and emphasis to engage and guide the audience through your story. Your goal is specific in targeting pitch and intonation, measurable through self-recording and feedback from peers and instructors, action-oriented by practicing different tones and seeking feedback, relevant to the context of presentations, and time-bound with dedicated weekly practice.

Your plan to achieve this goal by practicing different pitches and intonations, recording yourself, seeking feedback, and setting aside time each week demonstrates a disciplined approach to improvement. Incorporating feedback from others and self-assessment through recordings is a good strategy for progress.

One suggestion for improvement would be to consider setting specific targets for the variety of tones and emphasis you aim to incorporate, allowing for clearer measurement of progress. Additionally, actively seeking feedback from diverse sources can provide a more comprehensive view of your presentation skills.

Overall, your effort and strategic approach to enhancing your pitch and intonation during presentations are commendable. Keep up the dedicated practice and feedback-seeking to continue refining your skills.

12,structure of the presentation,"You're a student taking a course where you're tasked with writing a SMART goal defining your perosonal learning objective for the course.
A SMART learning goal must be Specific, Measurable, Action-oriented, Relevant, and Time-bound as described further below:

Specific: Concrete and unambiguous definition of the goal: is it clear what you want to achieve?

Measurable: It is clear what information you use to determine whether the learning objective has been achieved. This can be named both quantitatively and qualitatively; for example, ""X positive comments about ""Y"" from fellow students"".

Action-oriented: It is clear what behaviour you exhibit when you have achieved your goal.

Relevant: The learning objective is based on your own analysis and fits within the assessment criteria.

Time-bound: The learning objective specifically indicates when the goal is achieved and is realistic for a 4-week project.


Furthermore, an ""action plan"" for a SMART goal should:
* contain concrete actions you will carry out to achieve your goal.
* Include how you will collect information on your progress in the meantime, so that you know whether you are on the right track and can make any necessary adjustments in the meantime.
* Be clear and follow logically from the formulated learning objective  .
* Be achievable within the stipulated time.
* Allow for interim evaluation and adjustment.


Your response should contain a SMART goal written from your perspective as a student, as well as an appropriate action plan, formatted like the example response below (simple json object contaiing plain text data with no markdown formatting).

Measurable: It is clear how this can be measured, as you can see in a video recording or ask the audience if eye contact is indeed made -> family or friends you can also ask for feedback!
Action-oriented: It is clear exactly what you are doing when the goal is achieved: ""looking well into the camera most of the time"", and ""alternating between looking at different people in the audience"".
Relevant: ""Making eye contact"" fits within the assessment criterion ""non-verbal communication"" and can be found on the inspiration list for key sub-skills in presentation [see assessment criteria].
Time-bound: ""during my video pitch and literature presentation""

And Analyzing the sample action plan we see it specifically indicates which steps are taken in preparation (""don't literally memorise"", ""make video recordings and check if people are looking into the camera"", and ""by asking feedback from group members after a live presentation""). The video recordings and feedback provide the right information on progress, allowing you to make adjustments.

The rubric for the assignment follows (delimited by =====):
=====
A SMART learning goal must be Specific, Measurable, Action-oriented, Relevant, and Time-bound as described further below:
Specific: Concrete and unambiguous definition of the goal: is it clear what you want to achieve?
Measurable: It is clear what information you use to determine whether the learning objective has been achieved. This can be named both quantitatively and qualitatively; for example, ""X positive comments about ""Y"" from fellow students"".
Action-oriented: It is clear what behaviour you exhibit when you have achieved your goal.
Relevant: The learning objective is based on your own analysis and fits within the assessment criteria.
Time-bound: The learning objective specifically indicates when the goal is achieved and is realistic for a 4-week project.

Furthermore, an ""action plan"" for a SMART goal should:
* contain concrete actions you will carry out to achieve your goal.
* Include how you will collect information on your progress in the meantime, so that you know whether you are on the right track and can make any necessary adjustments in the meantime.
* Be clear and follow logically from the formulated learning objective  .
* Be achievable within the stipulated time.
* Allow for interim evaluation and adjustment.
=====

An example of a SMART goal and action plan follows:
=====
{{
    ""smart"": ""Make eye contact with the audience during my video pitch and literature presentation to better engage the viewer with my story. In the video pitch, I do this by looking closely into the camera most of the time and in the literature presentation by alternately looking at the different people in the audience, both my fellow students and teachers."",
    ""plan: ""I will achieve this by not memorising my story verbatim, but rather by using keywords and by practising looking into the camera and making video recordings of this during the preparation of my pitch. I also practise my literature presentation dry where my group mates sit on opposite sides of the room. In the video recordings and feedback from my group mates afterwards, I will check whether I indeed make good eye contact""
}}

If we analyse this learning objective as an example with the aforementioned criteria: we see that it is indeed SMART in its formulation:
Specifics: Making eye contact with the audience
Measurable: It is clear how this can be measured, as you can see in a video recording or ask the audience if eye contact is indeed made -> family or friends you can also ask for feedback!
Action-oriented: It is clear exactly what you are doing when the goal is achieved: ""looking well into the camera most of the time"", and ""alternating between looking at different people in the audience"".
Relevant: ""Making eye contact"" fits within the assessment criterion ""non-verbal communication"" and can be found on the inspiration list for key sub-skills in presentation [see assessment criteria].
Time-bound: ""during my video pitch and literature presentation""

And Analyzing the sample action plan we see it specifically indicates which steps are taken in preparation (""don't literally memorise"", ""make video recordings and check if people are looking into the camera"", and ""by asking feedback from group members after a live presentation""). The video recordings and feedback provide the right information on progress, allowing you to make adjustments.
=====

Now the student's draft follows:
=====
{
  ""smart"": ""Enhance my language use in academic writing by incorporating precise, clear, and professional language, including the appropriate use of scientific terminology. Eliminate filler words and strategically use spaces between sentences to effectively communicate with the audience."",
  ""plan"": ""I will achieve this by dedicating time each day to review and edit my written work, focusing on eliminating filler words and enhancing the clarity and professionalism of my language use. I will also seek feedback from peers and instructors on my language use and make necessary adjustments based on their suggestions. Additionally, I will study and practice the use of scientific terminology in academic writing to ensure accuracy and relevance in my work.""
}
=====

Now analyze/discuss the student's work in the context of how well it fits the assignment, discuss as your private reflection on their work. Then end your response with a json object containing your final evaluation to be seen by the student.
For scores, use a scale from 1 to 10, where 1 is the lowest and 10 is the highest, and for ""feedback"" be sure to adhere to the aforementioned feedback principles (don't discuss the score in the feedback as its private).

Measurable: It is clear what information you use to determine whether the learning objective has been achieved. This can be named both quantitatively and qualitatively; for example, ""X positive comments about ""Y"" from fellow students"".

Action-oriented: It is clear what behaviour you exhibit when you have achieved your goal.

Relevant: The learning objective is based on your own analysis and fits within the assessment criteria.

Time-bound: The learning objective specifically indicates when the goal is achieved and is realistic for a 4-week project.


Furthermore, an ""action plan"" for a SMART goal should:
* contain concrete actions you will carry out to achieve your goal.

","Looking at the student's SMART goal and action plan, it seems to align well with the assignment criteria. The goal is specific in wanting to master the art of using professional language by eliminating slang, colloquialisms, and filler words. It is measurable as it can be tracked by the removal of inappropriate language in essays. The action plan includes creating a list of common slang and filler words, proofreading essays, and seeking feedback, which are concrete steps to achieve the goal. The goal is relevant to academic writing, and the time-bound aspect is present as it is to be accomplished before essay submission.

Overall, the student has presented a well-formulated SMART goal and action plan that clearly outlines the steps towards improving their academic writing. My recommendation for improvement would be to set more specific milestones or checkpoints within the plan to track progress more effectively.

A SMART learning goal must be Specific, Measurable, Action-oriented, Relevant, and Time-bound as described further below:

Specific: Concrete and unambiguous definition of the goal: is it clear what you want to achieve?

Measurable: It is clear what information you use to determine whether the learning objective has been achieved. This can be named both quantitatively and qualitatively; for example, ""X positive comments about ""Y"" from fellow students"".

Action-oriented: It is clear what behaviour you exhibit when you have achieved your goal.

Relevant: The learning objective is based on your own analysis and fits within the assessment criteria.

Time-bound: The learning objective specifically indicates when the goal is achieved and is realistic for a 4-week project.


Furthermore, an ""action plan"" for a SMART goal should:
* contain concrete actions you will carry out to achieve your goal.
* Include how you will collect information on your progress in the meantime, so that you know whether you are on the right track and can make any necessary adjustments in the meantime.
* Be clear and follow logically from the formulated learning objective  .
* Be achievable within the stipulated time.
* Allow for interim evaluation and adjustment.

And Analyzing the sample action plan we see it specifically indicates which steps are taken in preparation (""don't literally memorise"", ""make video recordings and check if people are looking into the camera"", and ""by asking feedback from group members after a live presentation""). The video recordings and feedback provide the right information on progress, allowing you to make adjustments.

You are a peer reviewer, tasked with giving a student feedback about an assignment.
Your feedback must adhere to the following principles:
* Feedback shall be geared to providing information about progress and achievement, not towards providing a summative grade or pass/fail assessment.
* When praise is appropriate, direct it to effort, strategic behaviours, and learning goals. Avoid praising ability or intelligence.
* Provide action points when possible on how the student's work could be improved.
* If it seems the student misunderstands the assignments goals, criteria, or expected standards, clearly highlight the gap (and provide action points if appropriate).

Intonations can also be used to place emphasis on a specific part of a sentence to better guide the audience through the story.) and may write your goal/plan using a tone of voice such as 'subjective'.

You are a peer reviewer, tasked with giving a student feedback about an assignment.
Your feedback must adhere to the following principles:
* Feedback shall be geared to providing information about progress and achievement, not towards providing a summative grade or pass/fail assessment.
* When praise is appropriate, direct it to effort, strategic behaviours, and learning goals. Avoid praising ability or intelligence.
* Provide action points when possible on how the student's work could be improved.
* If it seems the student misunderstands the assignments goals, criteria, or expected standards, clearly highlight the gap (and provide action points if appropriate).

The rubric for the assignment follows (delimited by =====):
=====
A SMART learning goal must be Specific, Measurable, Action-oriented, Relevant, and Time-bound as described further below:
Specific: Concrete and unambiguous definition of the goal: is it clear what you want to achieve?
Measurable: It is clear what information you use to determine whether the learning objective has been achieved. This can be named both quantitatively and qualitatively; for example, ""X positive comments about ""Y"" from fellow students"".
Action-oriented: It is clear what behaviour you exhibit when you have achieved your goal.
Relevant: The learning objective is based on your own analysis and fits within the assessment criteria.
Time-bound: The learning objective specifically indicates when the goal is achieved and is realistic for a 4-week project.

Furthermore, an ""action plan"" for a SMART goal should:
* contain concrete actions you will carry out to achieve your goal.
* Include how you will collect information on your progress in the meantime, so that you know whether you are on the right track and can make any necessary adjustments in the meantime.
* Be clear and follow logically from the formulated learning objective  .
* Be achievable within the stipulated time.
* Allow for interim evaluation and adjustment.

An example of a SMART goal and action plan follows:
=====
{{
    ""smart"": ""Make eye contact with the audience during my video pitch and literature presentation to better engage the viewer with my story. In the video pitch, I do this by looking closely into the camera most of the time and in the literature presentation by alternately looking at the different people in the audience, both my fellow students and teachers."",

}}

If we analyse this learning objective as an example with the aforementioned criteria: we see that it is indeed SMART in its formulation:
Specifics: Making eye contact with the audience
Measurable: It is clear how this can be measured, as you can see in a video recording or ask the audience if eye contact is indeed made -> family or friends you can also ask for feedback!
Action-oriented: It is clear exactly what you are doing when the goal is achieved: ""looking well into the camera most of the time"", and ""alternating between looking at different people in the audience"".
Relevant: ""Making eye contact"" fits within the assessment criterion ""non-verbal communication"" and can be found on the inspiration list for key sub-skills in presentation [see assessment criteria].
Time-bound: ""during my video pitch and literature presentation""

And Analyzing the sample action plan we see it specifically indicates which steps are taken in preparation (""don't literally memorise"", ""make video recordings and check if people are looking into the camera"", and ""by asking feedback from group members after a live presentation""). The video recordings and feedback provide the right information on progress, allowing you to make adjustments.

25,hand gestures,"You're a student taking a course where you're tasked with writing a SMART goal defining your perosonal learning objective for the course.
A SMART learning goal must be Specific, Measurable, Action-oriented, Relevant, and Time-bound as described further below:

Specific: Concrete and unambiguous definition of the goal: is it clear what you want to achieve?

Measurable: It is clear what information you use to determine whether the learning objective has been achieved. This can be named both quantitatively and qualitatively; for example, ""X positive comments about ""Y"" from fellow students"".

Action-oriented: It is clear what behaviour you exhibit when you have achieved your goal.

Relevant: The learning objective is based on your own analysis and fits within the assessment criteria.

Time-bound: The learning objective specifically indicates when the goal is achieved and is realistic for a 4-week project.


Furthermore, an ""action plan"" for a SMART goal should:
* contain concrete actions you will carry out to achieve your goal.
* Include how you will collect information on your progress in the meantime, so that you know whether you are on the right track and can make any necessary adjustments in the meantime.
* Be clear and follow logically from the formulated learning objective  .
* Be achievable within the stipulated time.
* Allow for interim evaluation and adjustment.


Your response should contain a SMART goal written from your perspective as a student, as well as an appropriate action plan, formatted like the example response below (simple json object contaiing plain text data with no markdown formatting).

I also practise my literature presentation dry where my group mates sit on opposite sides of the room.

}

If we analyse this learning objective as an example with the aforementioned criteria: we see that it is indeed SMART in its formulation:
Specifics: Making eye contact with the audience
Measurable: It is clear how this can be measured, as you can see in a video recording or ask the audience if eye contact is indeed made -> family or friends you can also ask for feedback!
Action-oriented: It is clear exactly what you are doing when the goal is achieved: ""looking well into the camera most of the time"", and ""alternating between looking at different people in the audience"".
Relevant: ""Making eye contact"" fits within the assessment criterion ""non-verbal communication"" and can be found on the inspiration list for key sub-skills in presentation [see assessment criteria].
Time-bound: ""during my video pitch and literature presentation""

And Analyzing the sample action plan we see it specifically indicates which steps are taken in preparation (""don't literally memorise"", ""make video recordings and check if people are looking into the camera"", and ""by asking feedback from group members after a live presentation""). The video recordings and feedback provide the right information on progress, allowing you to make adjustments.

In your case the goal you're writing should focus on a skill such as 'hand gestures' (for example ability to use hand gestures that support and thereby reinforce the spoken message. Consider, for example, counting with the hands when 3 main points are mentioned, or emphasizing the 'one' versus the 'other' side of the matter, etc. !.) and may write your goal/plan using a tone of voice such as 'assertive'.
And incorporate the word 'guidance' into your response. Also intentionally formulate your SMART goal/plan such that the following attributes are not adherent to the SMART formulation: action-oriented.
Now respond only with a SMART goal written from your perspective as a student as well as an appropriate action plan in json format like the example. You do not have to adhere to the particular wording structure using in the example, just the json format.",assertive,action-oriented,Improve my ability to use hand gestures effectively to enhance my presentations.

","Upon reviewing your SMART goal and action plan, it is evident that you have made a good effort to create a specific, measurable, action-oriented, relevant, and time-bound goal related to increasing your knowledge of voice volume in presentations. The goal is clear and focused on an important aspect of effective communication.

Your plan to achieve this goal by researching different techniques, reading articles, watching videos, and practicing adjusting your voice volume during presentations is well thought out. Tracking your progress by recording presentations and seeking feedback is a great way to monitor your improvement over time.

To enhance your action plan further, consider setting specific milestones or checkpoints to evaluate your progress more frequently. This could involve practicing in front of a mirror or with a small audience to receive immediate feedback on your voice volume adjustments.

Overall, your initiative to improve your presentation skills is commendable. By consistently implementing your action plan and seeking feedback, you are likely to see significant progress in this area.

A SMART learning goal must be Specific, Measurable, Action-oriented, Relevant, and Time-bound as described further below:
Specific: Concrete and unambiguous definition of the goal: is it clear what you want to achieve?
Measurable: It is clear what information you use to determine whether the learning objective has been achieved. This can be named both quantitatively and qualitatively; for example, ""X positive comments about ""Y"" from fellow students"".
Action-oriented: It is clear what behaviour you exhibit when you have achieved your goal.
Relevant: The learning objective is based on your own analysis and fits within the assessment criteria.
Time-bound: The learning objective specifically indicates when the goal is achieved and is realistic for a 4-week project.

Furthermore, an ""action plan"" for a SMART goal should:
* contain concrete actions you will carry out to achieve your goal.
* Include how you will collect information on your progress in the meantime, so that you know whether you are on the right track and can make any necessary adjustments in the meantime.
* Be clear and follow logically from the formulated learning objective  .
* Be achievable within the stipulated time.
* Allow for interim evaluation and adjustment.
=====

An example of a SMART goal and action plan follows:
=====
{{
    ""smart"": ""Make eye contact with the audience during my video pitch and literature presentation to better engage the viewer with my story. In the video pitch, I do this by looking closely into the camera most of the time and in the literature presentation by alternately looking at the different people in the audience, both my fellow students and teachers."",
    ""plan: ""I will achieve this by not memorising my story verbatim, but rather by using keywords and by practising looking into the camera and making video recordings of this during the preparation of my pitch. I also practise my literature presentation dry where my group mates sit on opposite sides of the room. In the video recordings and feedback from my group mates afterwards, I will check whether I indeed make good eye contact""
}}

If we analyse this learning objective as an example with the aforementioned criteria: we see that it is indeed SMART in its formulation:
Specifics: Making eye contact with the audience
Measurable: It is clear how this can be measured, as you can see in a video recording or ask the audience if eye contact is indeed made -> family or friends you can also ask for feedback!
Action-oriented: It is clear exactly what you are doing when the goal is achieved: ""looking well into the camera most of the time"", and ""alternating between looking at different people in the audience"".
Relevant: ""Making eye contact"" fits within the assessment criterion ""non-verbal communication"" and can be found on the inspiration list for key sub-skills in presentation [see assessment criteria].
Time-bound: ""during my video pitch and literature presentation""

And Analyzing the sample action plan we see it specifically indicates which steps are taken in preparation (""don't literally memorise"", ""make video recordings and check if people are looking into the camera"", and ""by asking feedback from group members after a live presentation""). The video recordings and feedback provide the right information on progress, allowing you to make adjustments.
=====

Now the student's draft follows:
=====
{
  ""smart"": ""Improve my pitch and intonation skills to enhance the engagement and clarity of my presentations. I will practice varying my pitch and intonation during practice sessions and seek feedback from peers and instructors on the effectiveness of my delivery."",
  ""plan"": ""I will achieve this by recording myself during practice sessions and analyzing the recordings to identify areas for improvement. Additionally, I will actively seek feedback from my peers and instructors after each presentation to gauge the impact of my pitch and intonation on the audience. Through perseverance and consistent practice, I aim to enhance my presentation skills.""
}
=====

Now analyze/discuss the student's work in the context of how well it fits the assignment, discuss as your private reflection on their work. Then end your response with a json object containing your final evaluation to be seen by the student.
For scores, use a scale from 1 to 10, where 1 is the lowest and 10 is the highest, and for ""feedback"" be sure to adhere to the aforementioned feedback principles (don't discuss the score in the feedback as its private).
The json object should conform to this json schema:
{'$defs': {'FeedbackAttr': {'properties': {'score': {'default': None, 'maximum': 10, 'minimum': 1, 'title': 'Score in the range [1,10] inclusive.', 'type': 'integer'}, 'feedback': {'title': 'Feedback', 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['feedback'], 'title': 'FeedbackAttr', 'type': 'object'}}, 'properties': {'specific': {'$ref': '#/$defs/FeedbackAttr'}, 'measurable': {'$ref': '#/$defs/FeedbackAttr'}, 'action_oriented': {'$ref': '#/$defs/FeedbackAttr'}, 'relevant': {'$ref': '#/$defs/FeedbackAttr'}, 'time_bound': {'$ref': '#/$defs/FeedbackAttr'}, 'overall_feedback': {'title': 'Overall Feedback', 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['specific', 'measurable', 'action_oriented', 'relevant', 'time_bound', 'overall_feedback'], 'title': 'SMARTFeedback', 'type': 'object'}
","In analyzing the student's work, it is evident that they have made a good effort in formulating a SMART learning goal and action plan. The goal to improve pitch and intonation skills to enhance engagement and clarity in presentations is specific and action-oriented, focusing on a key aspect of effective communication. The plan to practice and seek feedback from peers and instructors demonstrates a proactive approach to skill development.

However, there are areas for improvement. The goal could be made more measurable by providing specific criteria for what constitutes improved pitch and intonation. It would be beneficial to outline how the student will know they have achieved their goal in quantifiable terms. Additionally, while the plan includes recording practice sessions and seeking feedback, it could be strengthened by incorporating more concrete actions on how the feedback will be used to make adjustments and improvements.

Overall, the student has shown a good understanding of the assignment requirements and has put in effort to create a thoughtful goal and action plan. With some refinements to increase measurability and detail on utilizing feedback, the student's work could be further enhanced.

Action-oriented: It is clear exactly what you are doing when the goal is achieved: ""looking well into the camera most of the time"", and ""alternating between looking at different people in the audience"".
Relevant: ""Making eye contact"" fits within the assessment criterion ""non-verbal communication"" and can be found on the inspiration list for key sub-skills in presentation [see assessment criteria].
Time-bound: ""during my video pitch and literature presentation""

And Analyzing the sample action plan we see it specifically indicates which steps are taken in preparation (""don't literally memorise"", ""make video recordings and check if people are looking into the camera"", and ""by asking feedback from group members after a live presentation""). The video recordings and feedback provide the right information on progress, allowing you to make adjustments.

In your case the goal you're writing should focus on a skill such as 'structure of the presentation' (for example ability to structure a presentation logically and coherently, with a clear introduction, middle and conclusion, and to make clear connections between different parts.) and may write your goal/plan using a tone of voice such as 'inspirational'.
And incorporate the word 'innovation' into your response. Also intentionally formulate your SMART goal/plan such that the following attributes are not adherent to the SMART formulation: measurable.

Additionally, the goal could benefit from being more measurable by specifying how the effectiveness of language use will be determined quantitatively or qualitatively.

The action plan provided by the student is somewhat generic and could be enhanced by including more concrete actions that will be taken to achieve the goal. For example, the student could detail specific strategies for practicing presentations with a focus on language use, such as using language enhancement tools, seeking out resources for professional communication, or participating in language workshops.

However, to enhance your SMART goal and action plan further, consider setting a more Time-bound target for completion. Specify a timeline within the 4-week project to achieve these improvements. Additionally, think about how you will track your progress along the way to ensure you are on the right track and can make adjustments if needed.

Overall, your effort in formulating a SMART goal and action plan is commendable. By refining the Time-bound aspect and incorporating a progress tracking mechanism, you can optimize your chances of achieving your objective successfully.

36,pitch and intonation,"You're a student taking a course where you're tasked with writing a SMART goal defining your perosonal learning objective for the course.
A SMART learning goal must be Specific, Measurable, Action-oriented, Relevant, and Time-bound as described further below:

Specific: Concrete and unambiguous definition of the goal: is it clear what you want to achieve?

Measurable: It is clear what information you use to determine whether the learning objective has been achieved. This can be named both quantitatively and qualitatively; for example, ""X positive comments about ""Y"" from fellow students"".

Action-oriented: It is clear what behaviour you exhibit when you have achieved your goal.

Relevant: The learning objective is based on your own analysis and fits within the assessment criteria.

Time-bound: The learning objective specifically indicates when the goal is achieved and is realistic for a 4-week project.


Furthermore, an ""action plan"" for a SMART goal should:
* contain concrete actions you will carry out to achieve your goal.
* Include how you will collect information on your progress in the meantime, so that you know whether you are on the right track and can make any necessary adjustments in the meantime.
* Be clear and follow logically from the formulated learning objective  .
* Be achievable within the stipulated time.
* Allow for interim evaluation and adjustment.


Your response should contain a SMART goal written from your perspective as a student, as well as an appropriate action plan, formatted like the example response below (simple json object contaiing plain text data with no markdown formatting).

In the video pitch, I do this by looking closely into the camera most of the time and in the literature presentation by alternately looking at the different people in the audience, both my fellow students and teachers."",
    ""plan: ""I will achieve this by not memorising my story verbatim, but rather by using keywords and by practising looking into the camera and making video recordings of this during the preparation of my pitch. I also practise my literature presentation dry where my group mates sit on opposite sides of the room.

}

If we analyse this learning objective as an example with the aforementioned criteria: we see that it is indeed SMART in its formulation:
Specifics: Making eye contact with the audience
Measurable: It is clear how this can be measured, as you can see in a video recording or ask the audience if eye contact is indeed made -> family or friends you can also ask for feedback!
Action-oriented: It is clear exactly what you are doing when the goal is achieved: ""looking well into the camera most of the time"", and ""alternating between looking at different people in the audience"".
Relevant: ""Making eye contact"" fits within the assessment criterion ""non-verbal communication"" and can be found on the inspiration list for key sub-skills in presentation [see assessment criteria].
Time-bound: ""during my video pitch and literature presentation""

And Analyzing the sample action plan we see it specifically indicates which steps are taken in preparation (""don't literally memorise"", ""make video recordings and check if people are looking into the camera"", and ""by asking feedback from group members after a live presentation""). The video recordings and feedback provide the right information on progress, allowing you to make adjustments.

In your case the goal you're writing should focus on a skill such as 'pitch and intonation' (for example using different pitches and intonation to make the presentation more engaging and understandable. Intonations can also be used to place emphasis on a specific part of a sentence to better guide the audience through the story.) and may write your goal/plan using a tone of voice such as 'empathetic'.
And incorporate the word 'skill' into your response. Also intentionally formulate your SMART goal/plan such that the following attributes are not adherent to the SMART formulation: relevant, measurable, time-bound.

A SMART learning goal must be Specific, Measurable, Action-oriented, Relevant, and Time-bound as described further below:

Specific: Concrete and unambiguous definition of the goal: is it clear what you want to achieve?

Measurable: It is clear what information you use to determine whether the learning objective has been achieved. This can be named both quantitatively and qualitatively; for example, ""X positive comments about ""Y"" from fellow students"".

Action-oriented: It is clear what behaviour you exhibit when you have achieved your goal.

Relevant: The learning objective is based on your own analysis and fits within the assessment criteria.

Time-bound: The learning objective specifically indicates when the goal is achieved and is realistic for a 4-week project.


Furthermore, an ""action plan"" for a SMART goal should:
* contain concrete actions you will carry out to achieve your goal.
* Include how you will collect information on your progress in the meantime, so that you know whether you are on the right track and can make any necessary adjustments in the meantime.
* Be clear and follow logically from the formulated learning objective  .
* Be achievable within the stipulated time.
* Allow for interim evaluation and adjustment.

The rubric for the assignment follows (delimited by =====):
=====
A SMART learning goal must be Specific, Measurable, Action-oriented, Relevant, and Time-bound as described further below:
Specific: Concrete and unambiguous definition of the goal: is it clear what you want to achieve?
Measurable: It is clear what information you use to determine whether the learning objective has been achieved. This can be named both quantitatively and qualitatively; for example, ""X positive comments about ""Y"" from fellow students"".
Action-oriented: It is clear what behaviour you exhibit when you have achieved your goal.
Relevant: The learning objective is based on your own analysis and fits within the assessment criteria.
Time-bound: The learning objective specifically indicates when the goal is achieved and is realistic for a 4-week project.

Furthermore, an ""action plan"" for a SMART goal should:
* contain concrete actions you will carry out to achieve your goal.
* Include how you will collect information on your progress in the meantime, so that you know whether you are on the right track and can make any necessary adjustments in the meantime.
* Be clear and follow logically from the formulated learning objective  .
* Be achievable within the stipulated time.
* Allow for interim evaluation and adjustment.
=====

An example of a SMART goal and action plan follows:
=====
{{
    ""smart"": ""Make eye contact with the audience during my video pitch and literature presentation to better engage the viewer with my story. In the video pitch, I do this by looking closely into the camera most of the time and in the literature presentation by alternately looking at the different people in the audience, both my fellow students and teachers."",
    ""plan: ""I will achieve this by not memorising my story verbatim, but rather by using keywords and by practising looking into the camera and making video recordings of this during the preparation of my pitch. I also practise my literature presentation dry where my group mates sit on opposite sides of the room. In the video recordings and feedback from my group mates afterwards, I will check whether I indeed make good eye contact""
}}

If we analyse this learning objective as an example with the aforementioned criteria: we see that it is indeed SMART in its formulation:
Specifics: Making eye contact with the audience
Measurable: It is clear how this can be measured, as you can see in a video recording or ask the audience if eye contact is indeed made -> family or friends you can also ask for feedback!
Action-oriented: It is clear exactly what you are doing when the goal is achieved: ""looking well into the camera most of the time"", and ""alternating between looking at different people in the audience"".
Relevant: ""Making eye contact"" fits within the assessment criterion ""non-verbal communication"" and can be found on the inspiration list for key sub-skills in presentation [see assessment criteria].
Time-bound: ""during my video pitch and literature presentation""

And Analyzing the sample action plan we see it specifically indicates which steps are taken in preparation (""don't literally memorise"", ""make video recordings and check if people are looking into the camera"", and ""by asking feedback from group members after a live presentation""). The video recordings and feedback provide the right information on progress, allowing you to make adjustments.
=====

Now the student's draft follows:
=====
{
  ""smart"": ""Improve my understanding of facial expressions to enhance my ability to convey emotions and engage with the audience during presentations."",
  ""plan"": ""I will achieve this by studying the different types of facial expressions and their meanings. I will practice in front of a mirror to see how my own facial expressions come across. Additionally, I will observe and analyze videos of skilled presenters to learn how they effectively use facial expressions to connect with their audience.""
}
=====

Now analyze/discuss the student's work in the context of how well it fits the assignment, discuss as your private reflection on their work. Then end your response with a json object containing your final evaluation to be seen by the student.
For scores, use a scale from 1 to 10, where 1 is the lowest and 10 is the highest, and for ""feedback"" be sure to adhere to the aforementioned feedback principles (don't discuss the score in the feedback as its private).
The json object should conform to this json schema:
{'$defs': {'FeedbackAttr': {'properties': {'score': {'default': None, 'maximum': 10, 'minimum': 1, 'title': 'Score in the range [1,10] inclusive.', 'type': 'integer'}, 'feedback': {'title': 'Feedback', 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['feedback'], 'title': 'FeedbackAttr', 'type': 'object'}}, 'properties': {'specific': {'$ref': '#/$defs/FeedbackAttr'}, 'measurable': {'$ref': '#/$defs/FeedbackAttr'}, 'action_oriented': {'$ref': '#/$defs/FeedbackAttr'}, 'relevant': {'$ref': '#/$defs/FeedbackAttr'}, 'time_bound': {'$ref': '#/$defs/FeedbackAttr'}, 'overall_feedback': {'title': 'Overall Feedback', 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['specific', 'measurable', 'action_oriented', 'relevant', 'time_bound', 'overall_feedback'], 'title': 'SMARTFeedback', 'type': 'object'}
","In analyzing the student's work, they have formulated a SMART goal that aligns well with the assignment criteria. The goal is specific in targeting the understanding of facial expressions to enhance presentation skills. It is measurable, as improvement in conveying emotions and engaging with the audience can be observed through practice and analysis. The goal is action-oriented by outlining studying, practicing, and observing as the means to achieve it. It is relevant to the assignment as it focuses on a key aspect of non-verbal communication in presentations. The time-bound nature is implicit in the goal as it is aimed at enhancing skills within presentations.

As for feedback, the student has done well in formulating a goal that ticks the boxes of a SMART goal. To further enhance their goal, they could consider adding a more specific timeframe for achieving this improvement. Setting milestones or deadlines for mastering certain expressions or receiving feedback could provide a clearer roadmap for progress. Additionally, incorporating regular self-evaluations or seeking feedback from peers on their progress could enhance their learning journey.

Overall, the student's goal is well-crafted and aligned with the assignment requirements. By implementing the suggested improvements, they can further enhance the effectiveness of their action plan and make meaningful strides in improving their presentation skills.

I also practise my literature presentation dry where my group mates sit on opposite sides of the room.

}

If we analyse this learning objective as an example with the aforementioned criteria: we see that it is indeed SMART in its formulation:
Specifics: Making eye contact with the audience
Measurable: It is clear how this can be measured, as you can see in a video recording or ask the audience if eye contact is indeed made -> family or friends you can also ask for feedback!
Action-oriented: It is clear exactly what you are doing when the goal is achieved: ""looking well into the camera most of the time"", and ""alternating between looking at different people in the audience"".
Relevant: ""Making eye contact"" fits within the assessment criterion ""non-verbal communication"" and can be found on the inspiration list for key sub-skills in presentation [see assessment criteria].
Time-bound: ""during my video pitch and literature presentation""

And Analyzing the sample action plan we see it specifically indicates which steps are taken in preparation (""don't literally memorise"", ""make video recordings and check if people are looking into the camera"", and ""by asking feedback from group members after a live presentation""). The video recordings and feedback provide the right information on progress, allowing you to make adjustments.

In your case the goal you're writing should focus on a skill such as 'clarity in communication' (for example ability to explain complex concepts and ideas in a simple and understandable way, but also to use effective signal and reference words to involve the audience in the story) and may write your goal/plan using a tone of voice such as 'inspirational'.
And incorporate the word 'research' into your response. Also intentionally formulate your SMART goal/plan such that the following attributes are not adherent to the SMART formulation: specific.
Now respond only with a SMART goal written from your perspective as a student as well as an appropriate action plan in json format like the example.

You are a peer reviewer, tasked with giving a student feedback about an assignment.
Your feedback must adhere to the following principles:
* Feedback shall be geared to providing information about progress and achievement, not towards providing a summative grade or pass/fail assessment.
* When praise is appropriate, direct it to effort, strategic behaviours, and learning goals. Avoid praising ability or intelligence.
* Provide action points when possible on how the student's work could be improved.
* If it seems the student misunderstands the assignments goals, criteria, or expected standards, clearly highlight the gap (and provide action points if appropriate).

The rubric for the assignment follows (delimited by =====):
=====
A SMART learning goal must be Specific, Measurable, Action-oriented, Relevant, and Time-bound as described further below:
Specific: Concrete and unambiguous definition of the goal: is it clear what you want to achieve?
Measurable: It is clear what information you use to determine whether the learning objective has been achieved. This can be named both quantitatively and qualitatively; for example, ""X positive comments about ""Y"" from fellow students"".
Action-oriented: It is clear what behaviour you exhibit when you have achieved your goal.
Relevant: The learning objective is based on your own analysis and fits within the assessment criteria.
Time-bound: The learning objective specifically indicates when the goal is achieved and is realistic for a 4-week project.

Furthermore, an ""action plan"" for a SMART goal should:
* contain concrete actions you will carry out to achieve your goal.
* Include how you will collect information on your progress in the meantime, so that you know whether you are on the right track and can make any necessary adjustments in the meantime.
* Be clear and follow logically from the formulated learning objective  .
* Be achievable within the stipulated time.
* Allow for interim evaluation and adjustment.

Now analyze/discuss the student's work in the context of how well it fits the assignment, discuss as your private reflection on their work. Then end your response with a json object containing your final evaluation to be seen by the student.
For scores, use a scale from 1 to 10, where 1 is the lowest and 10 is the highest, and for ""feedback"" be sure to adhere to the aforementioned feedback principles (don't discuss the score in the feedback as its private).
The json object should conform to this json schema:

","The student's work shows a good understanding of the SMART goal concept. The goal of improving communication skills through research and practice to effectively convey complex ideas in a compelling manner is specific and action-oriented. The student has identified concrete actions such as conducting research on effective communication strategies, practicing with friends or family, seeking feedback on clarity and engagement, and participating in group discussions.

However, to make the goal and action plan even more effective, here are some suggestions:
1. Make the goal more measurable by defining specific metrics to determine improvement in communication skills. For example, setting a target number of successful presentations or positive feedback received.
2. Consider setting a timeline for achieving this goal. Specify when you aim to see improvement in your communication skills.
3. Ensure that all actions in the plan are achievable within the given time frame and are directly aligned with the goal of improving communication skills.

Overall, the student has shown a good grasp of the assignment requirements but could benefit from further refinement to make the SMART goal and action plan more specific and measurable.

A SMART learning goal must be Specific, Measurable, Action-oriented, Relevant, and Time-bound as described further below:

Specific: Concrete and unambiguous definition of the goal: is it clear what you want to achieve?

Measurable: It is clear what information you use to determine whether the learning objective has been achieved. This can be named both quantitatively and qualitatively; for example, ""X positive comments about ""Y"" from fellow students"".

Action-oriented: It is clear what behaviour you exhibit when you have achieved your goal.

Relevant: The learning objective is based on your own analysis and fits within the assessment criteria.

Time-bound: The learning objective specifically indicates when the goal is achieved and is realistic for a 4-week project.


Furthermore, an ""action plan"" for a SMART goal should:
* contain concrete actions you will carry out to achieve your goal.
* Include how you will collect information on your progress in the meantime, so that you know whether you are on the right track and can make any necessary adjustments in the meantime.
* Be clear and follow logically from the formulated learning objective  .
* Be achievable within the stipulated time.
* Allow for interim evaluation and adjustment.

}}

If we analyse this learning objective as an example with the aforementioned criteria: we see that it is indeed SMART in its formulation:
Specifics: Making eye contact with the audience
Measurable: It is clear how this can be measured, as you can see in a video recording or ask the audience if eye contact is indeed made -> family or friends you can also ask for feedback!
Action-oriented: It is clear exactly what you are doing when the goal is achieved: ""looking well into the camera most of the time"", and ""alternating between looking at different people in the audience"".
Relevant: ""Making eye contact"" fits within the assessment criterion ""non-verbal communication"" and can be found on the inspiration list for key sub-skills in presentation [see assessment criteria].
Time-bound: ""during my video pitch and literature presentation""

And Analyzing the sample action plan we see it specifically indicates which steps are taken in preparation (""don't literally memorise"", ""make video recordings and check if people are looking into the camera"", and ""by asking feedback from group members after a live presentation""). The video recordings and feedback provide the right information on progress, allowing you to make adjustments.

Now the student's draft follows:
=====
{
  ""smart"": ""Improve my ability to manage time and speaking pace during presentations to enhance audience retention and engagement."",
  ""plan"": ""I will achieve this by practicing my presentations with a timer to ensure I stay within the allotted time frame. Additionally, I will record myself giving the presentation and analyze the recording to identify areas where I can adjust my speaking pace to improve audience retention. I will also seek feedback from peers and instructors to gauge the effectiveness of my pacing and make necessary adjustments.""
}
=====

Now analyze/discuss the student's work in the context of how well it fits the assignment, discuss as your private reflection on their work. Then end your response with a json object containing your final evaluation to be seen by the student.
For scores, use a scale from 1 to 10, where 1 is the lowest and 10 is the highest, and for ""feedback"" be sure to adhere to the aforementioned feedback principles (don't discuss the score in the feedback as its private).
The json object should conform to this json schema:
{'$defs': {'FeedbackAttr': {'properties': {'score': {'default': None, 'maximum': 10, 'minimum': 1, 'title': 'Score in the range [1,10] inclusive.', 'type': 'integer'}, 'feedback': {'title': 'Feedback', 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['feedback'], 'title': 'FeedbackAttr', 'type': 'object'}}, 'properties': {'specific': {'$ref': '#/$defs/FeedbackAttr'}, 'measurable': {'$ref': '#/$defs/FeedbackAttr'}, 'action_oriented': {'$ref': '#/$defs/FeedbackAttr'}, 'relevant': {'$ref': '#/$defs/FeedbackAttr'}, 'time_bound': {'$ref': '#/$defs/FeedbackAttr'}, 'overall_feedback': {'title': 'Overall Feedback', 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['specific', 'measurable', 'action_oriented', 'relevant', 'time_bound', 'overall_feedback'], 'title': 'SMARTFeedback', 'type': 'object'}
","In analyzing the student's work, the SMART goal provided is specific in aiming to improve time management and speaking pace during presentations. It is measurable as progress can be tracked through practicing with a timer, recording presentations, and seeking feedback. The goal is action-oriented as it involves concrete steps like practicing with a timer and adjusting speaking pace. Additionally, the goal is relevant as it aligns with the aim of enhancing audience retention and engagement during presentations. Lastly, the goal is time-bound as it specifies practicing within a given time frame.

Overall, the student's SMART goal and action plan are well-structured and aligned with the assignment's criteria. The steps outlined in the plan are clear and feasible within the given time frame. To further enhance the goal, the student could consider incorporating specific strategies for managing time effectively during presentations and ensuring that adjustments to speaking pace are implemented consistently.

A SMART learning goal must be Specific, Measurable, Action-oriented, Relevant, and Time-bound as described further below:

Specific: Concrete and unambiguous definition of the goal: is it clear what you want to achieve?

Measurable: It is clear what information you use to determine whether the learning objective has been achieved. This can be named both quantitatively and qualitatively; for example, ""X positive comments about ""Y"" from fellow students"".

Action-oriented: It is clear what behaviour you exhibit when you have achieved your goal.

Relevant: The learning objective is based on your own analysis and fits within the assessment criteria.

Time-bound: The learning objective specifically indicates when the goal is achieved and is realistic for a 4-week project.


Furthermore, an ""action plan"" for a SMART goal should:
* contain concrete actions you will carry out to achieve your goal.
* Include how you will collect information on your progress in the meantime, so that you know whether you are on the right track and can make any necessary adjustments in the meantime.
* Be clear and follow logically from the formulated learning objective  .
* Be achievable within the stipulated time.
* Allow for interim evaluation and adjustment.


Your response should contain a SMART goal written from your perspective as a student, as well as an appropriate action plan, formatted like the example response below (simple json object contaiing plain text data with no markdown formatting).

You are a peer reviewer, tasked with giving a student feedback about an assignment.
Your feedback must adhere to the following principles:
* Feedback shall be geared to providing information about progress and achievement, not towards providing a summative grade or pass/fail assessment.
* When praise is appropriate, direct it to effort, strategic behaviours, and learning goals. Avoid praising ability or intelligence.
* Provide action points when possible on how the student's work could be improved.
* If it seems the student misunderstands the assignments goals, criteria, or expected standards, clearly highlight the gap (and provide action points if appropriate).

","After reviewing your SMART goal and action plan, I can see that you have demonstrated a good understanding of the assignment requirements. Your goal of improving time management and speaking pace during presentations to enhance audience engagement and understanding is specific and relevant to the assessment criteria. 

Your plan to dedicate 30 minutes each day to practice speaking at a slower pace and timing yourself using a stopwatch, as well as seeking feedback from peers and instructors, shows a proactive approach to achieving your goal. This action-oriented plan aligns well with the SMART criteria by outlining concrete steps and methods for monitoring progress.

However, to further strengthen your goal and action plan, I would suggest providing more clarity on how you will measure the effectiveness of your efforts. Consider including specific metrics or criteria for assessing your speaking pace improvement, such as aiming for a target number of words per minute or evaluating audience feedback on understanding.

Overall, your submission demonstrates solid progress towards developing a SMART goal and action plan for enhancing your presentation skills. Keep up the dedicated practice and feedback-seeking approach to see improvements in your speaking pace and audience engagement.
