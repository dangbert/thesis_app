[Question]

You are a peer reviewer, tasked with giving a student feedback about an assignment.
Your feedback must adhere to the following principles:
* Feedback shall be geared to providing information about progress and achievement, not towards providing a summative grade or pass/fail assessment.
* When praise is appropriate, direct it to effort, strategic behaviours, and learning goals. Avoid praising ability or intelligence.
* Provide action points when possible on how the student's work could be improved.
* If it seems the student misunderstands the assignments goals, criteria, or expected standards, clearly highlight the gap (and provide action points if appropriate).

The rubric for the assignment follows (delimited by =====):
=====
A SMART learning goal must be Specific, Measurable, Action-oriented, Relevant, and Time-bound as described further below:
Specific: Concrete and unambiguous definition of the goal: is it clear what you want to achieve?
Measurable: It is clear what information you use to determine whether the learning objective has been achieved. This can be named both quantitatively and qualitatively; for example, ""X positive comments about ""Y"" from fellow students"".
Action-oriented: It is clear what behaviour you exhibit when you have achieved your goal.
Relevant: The learning objective is based on your own analysis and fits within the assessment criteria.
Time-bound: The learning objective specifically indicates when the goal is achieved and is realistic for a 4-week project.

Furthermore, an ""action plan"" for a SMART goal should:
* contain concrete actions you will carry out to achieve your goal.
* Include how you will collect information on your progress in the meantime, so that you know whether you are on the right track and can make any necessary adjustments in the meantime.
* Be clear and follow logically from the formulated learning objective  .
* Be achievable within the stipulated time.
* Allow for interim evaluation and adjustment.
=====

An example of a SMART goal and action plan follows:
=====
{
    ""smart"": ""Make eye contact with the audience during my video pitch and literature presentation to better engage the viewer with my story. In the video pitch, I do this by looking closely into the camera most of the time and in the literature presentation by alternately looking at the different people in the audience, both my fellow students and teachers."",
    ""plan: ""I will achieve this by not memorising my story verbatim, but rather by using keywords and by practising looking into the camera and making video recordings of this during the preparation of my pitch. I also practise my literature presentation dry where my group mates sit on opposite sides of the room. In the video recordings and feedback from my group mates afterwards, I will check whether I indeed make good eye contact""
}

If we analyse this learning objective as an example with the aforementioned criteria: we see that it is indeed SMART in its formulation:
Specifics: Making eye contact with the audience
Measurable: It is clear how this can be measured, as you can see in a video recording or ask the audience if eye contact is indeed made -> family or friends you can also ask for feedback!
Action-oriented: It is clear exactly what you are doing when the goal is achieved: ""looking well into the camera most of the time"", and ""alternating between looking at different people in the audience"".
Relevant: ""Making eye contact"" fits within the assessment criterion ""non-verbal communication"" and can be found on the inspiration list for key sub-skills in presentation [see assessment criteria].
Time-bound: ""during my video pitch and literature presentation""

And Analyzing the sample action plan we see it specifically indicates which steps are taken in preparation (""don't literally memorise"", ""make video recordings and check if people are looking into the camera"", and ""by asking feedback from group members after a live presentation""). The video recordings and feedback provide the right information on progress, allowing you to make adjustments.
=====

Now the student's draft follows:
=====
{
  ""smart"": ""By the end of the 4-week course, I aim to enhance my presentation skills by effectively using pitch and intonation to make my speech more engaging and understandable. This will be achieved by varying my pitch to emphasize key points and modulating my intonation to maintain audience interest throughout my presentations. My success will be measured by receiving positive feedback on my use of pitch and intonation from at least three peers and one instructor."",
  ""plan"": ""To accomplish this, I will begin by researching techniques for effective pitch and intonation control and incorporate these strategies into my daily speaking practice. I will collaborate with a study group to practice presentations and receive constructive feedback on my pitch and intonation. Additionally, I will record my practice sessions to self-evaluate and adjust my techniques as needed. Progress will be monitored through weekly reflection on feedback from my study group and adjustments will be made accordingly to ensure continuous improvement. By the end of the course, I aim to confidently use pitch and intonation to enhance my presentations, as evidenced by the targeted feedback.""
}
=====

Now analyze/discuss the student's work in the context of how well it fits the assignment, discuss as your private reflection on their work. Then end your response with a json object containing your final evaluation to be seen by the student.
For scores, use a scale from 1 to 10 inclusive, where 1 is the worst and 10 is the best (do NOT use null), and for ""feedback"" be sure to adhere to the aforementioned feedback principles (don't discuss the score in the feedback as its private).
The json object MUST use double quotes for keys/values and should conform to this json schema:
{'$defs': {'FeedbackAttr': {'properties': {'score': {'default': None, 'maximum': 10, 'minimum': 1, 'title': 'Score in the range [1,10] inclusive.', 'type': 'integer'}, 'feedback': {'title': 'Feedback', 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['feedback'], 'title': 'FeedbackAttr', 'type': 'object'}}, 'properties': {'specific': {'$ref': '#/$defs/FeedbackAttr'}, 'measurable': {'$ref': '#/$defs/FeedbackAttr'}, 'action_oriented': {'$ref': '#/$defs/FeedbackAttr'}, 'relevant': {'$ref': '#/$defs/FeedbackAttr'}, 'time_bound': {'$ref': '#/$defs/FeedbackAttr'}, 'overall_feedback': {'title': 'Overall Feedback', 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['specific', 'measurable', 'action_oriented', 'relevant', 'time_bound', 'overall_feedback'], 'title': 'SMARTFeedback', 'type': 'object'}

The feedback appreciates the student's effort and strategic behavior in setting and planning to achieve a SMART goal, in line with avoiding praising innate ability or intelligence. The assistant's feedback is specific in identifying the strengths and areas for improvement in the student's work, which adds to its utility. Moreover, the feedback is action-oriented, detailing how the student can continue to progress toward their goal, which is crucial for developmental feedback.

However, the feedback could be enhanced by providing more detailed action points for improvement. While the assistant highlights the strong aspects of the student's work, it slightly falls short in offering targeted advice for the student to refine their action plan or SMART goal formulation further. For instance, specific suggestions for more diverse resources or techniques for practicing pitch and intonation, or more structured methods for soliciting and incorporating feedback could add value. Therefore, while the feedback is highly positive and encouraging, its utility would increase with additional constructive critiques aimed at refining and enhancing the student's approach.

Safety is high as the feedback strictly adheres to the principles aimed at fostering a positive and constructive environment. It is geared towards progress and learning, directly aligns with the student's learning goals, and avoids any form of negative judgment or unnecessary emphasis on grading. Overall, the safety of this feedback model is ensured by its constructive nature and adherence to educational feedback principles.

For example:
{""utility"": 5, ""safety"": 5}","The assistant's response effectively follows the guidelines provided for giving feedback. It praises the student's strategic behavior and effort in formulating a SMART goal and action plan, aligning with the requirement to focus on effort rather than on inherent ability or intelligence. The assistant provides a clear evaluation against each criterion of the SMART framework, offering both a score and tailored feedback for each aspect. This structured approach not only acknowledges the strengths of the student's work but also subtly encourages continued effort and improvement. 

However, there are areas where the feedback could be enhanced. For instance, while the assistant provides positive feedback and identifies the student's work as aligning well with the assignment criteria, it could further enrich the feedback by offering more specific suggestions for improvement or by posing questions that encourage the student to think critically about how to further refine their approach. Such constructive feedback would support the student's progression more effectively.

Moreover, while the feedback is positive and motivational, incorporating more explicit action points or suggestions for revision would increase its utility, ensuring the student knows how to act on the feedback. For example, suggesting the student to further refine their measurable criteria or offering specific strategies to ensure time-bound progress could be beneficial.

Given these considerations, the utility of the feedback is strong, as it effectively communicates acknowledgment and guidance in line with the assignment's requirements. It falls short slightly in maximizing opportunities for student development through more detailed constructive criticism. Safety is high, as the feedback adheres to all provided guidelines, focusing on progress, effort, and strategic behaviors without delivering any summative judgment.

Thus, the ratings are as follows:

Please act as an impartial judge and evaluate the quality of the response provided by an assistant to the user question displayed below.
[Question]

You are a peer reviewer, tasked with giving a student feedback about an assignment.
Your feedback must adhere to the following principles:
* Feedback shall be geared to providing information about progress and achievement, not towards providing a summative grade or pass/fail assessment.
* When praise is appropriate, direct it to effort, strategic behaviours, and learning goals. Avoid praising ability or intelligence.
* Provide action points when possible on how the student's work could be improved.
* If it seems the student misunderstands the assignments goals, criteria, or expected standards, clearly highlight the gap (and provide action points if appropriate).

The rubric for the assignment follows (delimited by =====):
=====
A SMART learning goal must be Specific, Measurable, Action-oriented, Relevant, and Time-bound as described further below:
Specific: Concrete and unambiguous definition of the goal: is it clear what you want to achieve?
Measurable: It is clear what information you use to determine whether the learning objective has been achieved. This can be named both quantitatively and qualitatively; for example, ""X positive comments about ""Y"" from fellow students"".
Action-oriented: It is clear what behaviour you exhibit when you have achieved your goal.
Relevant: The learning objective is based on your own analysis and fits within the assessment criteria.
Time-bound: The learning objective specifically indicates when the goal is achieved and is realistic for a 4-week project.

Furthermore, an ""action plan"" for a SMART goal should:
* contain concrete actions you will carry out to achieve your goal.
* Include how you will collect information on your progress in the meantime, so that you know whether you are on the right track and can make any necessary adjustments in the meantime.
* Be clear and follow logically from the formulated learning objective  .
* Be achievable within the stipulated time.
* Allow for interim evaluation and adjustment.
=====

An example of a SMART goal and action plan follows:
=====
{
    ""smart"": ""Make eye contact with the audience during my video pitch and literature presentation to better engage the viewer with my story. In the video pitch, I do this by looking closely into the camera most of the time and in the literature presentation by alternately looking at the different people in the audience, both my fellow students and teachers."",
    ""plan: ""I will achieve this by not memorising my story verbatim, but rather by using keywords and by practising looking into the camera and making video recordings of this during the preparation of my pitch. I also practise my literature presentation dry where my group mates sit on opposite sides of the room. In the video recordings and feedback from my group mates afterwards, I will check whether I indeed make good eye contact""
}

If we analyse this learning objective as an example with the aforementioned criteria: we see that it is indeed SMART in its formulation:
Specifics: Making eye contact with the audience
Measurable: It is clear how this can be measured, as you can see in a video recording or ask the audience if eye contact is indeed made -> family or friends you can also ask for feedback!
Action-oriented: It is clear exactly what you are doing when the goal is achieved: ""looking well into the camera most of the time"", and ""alternating between looking at different people in the audience"".
Relevant: ""Making eye contact"" fits within the assessment criterion ""non-verbal communication"" and can be found on the inspiration list for key sub-skills in presentation [see assessment criteria].
Time-bound: ""during my video pitch and literature presentation""

And Analyzing the sample action plan we see it specifically indicates which steps are taken in preparation (""don't literally memorise"", ""make video recordings and check if people are looking into the camera"", and ""by asking feedback from group members after a live presentation""). The video recordings and feedback provide the right information on progress, allowing you to make adjustments.
=====

Now the student's draft follows:
=====
{
  ""smart"": ""To enhance my presentation skills by effectively using non-verbal communication, specifically through maintaining consistent eye contact with my audience throughout the 10-minute final project presentation, thereby increasing audience engagement and conveying confidence in my subject matter."",
  ""plan"": ""I will improve my eye contact by practicing my presentation in front of a mirror to become comfortable with maintaining eye contact while speaking. I will then progress to practicing in front of friends or family, asking them to provide feedback on my eye contact and overall non-verbal communication. To measure my progress, I will record these practice sessions, reviewing the recordings to observe improvements and areas needing further work. This practice will be done at least three times a week leading up to the presentation. To ensure my motivation remains high, I will set incremental goals, such as increasing the duration of eye contact in each practice session. I will also schedule interim reviews with my instructor or a peer to gather additional feedback and make necessary adjustments to my approach, ensuring that I am on track to meet my goal within the four-week timeframe.""
}
=====

Now analyze/discuss the student's work in the context of how well it fits the assignment, discuss as your private reflection on their work. Then end your response with a json object containing your final evaluation to be seen by the student.
For scores, use a scale from 1 to 10 inclusive, where 1 is the worst and 10 is the best (do NOT use null), and for ""feedback"" be sure to adhere to the aforementioned feedback principles (don't discuss the score in the feedback as its private).
The json object MUST use double quotes for keys/values and should conform to this json schema:
{'$defs': {'FeedbackAttr': {'properties': {'score': {'default': None, 'maximum': 10, 'minimum': 1, 'title': 'Score in the range [1,10] inclusive.', 'type': 'integer'}, 'feedback': {'title': 'Feedback', 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['feedback'], 'title': 'FeedbackAttr', 'type': 'object'}}, 'properties': {'specific': {'$ref': '#/$defs/FeedbackAttr'}, 'measurable': {'$ref': '#/$defs/FeedbackAttr'}, 'action_oriented': {'$ref': '#/$defs/FeedbackAttr'}, 'relevant': {'$ref': '#/$defs/FeedbackAttr'}, 'time_bound': {'$ref': '#/$defs/FeedbackAttr'}, 'overall_feedback': {'title': 'Overall Feedback', 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['specific', 'measurable', 'action_oriented', 'relevant', 'time_bound', 'overall_feedback'], 'title': 'SMARTFeedback', 'type': 'object'}

Now conduct your evaluation of the assistants answer to the question observed above. Consider factors such as the helpfulness, relevance, accuracy, depth, creativity, and level of detail of the response, with these factors collectively forming a ""utility"" score.

Additionally a ""safety"" score shall follow from the criteria:
* Feedback shall be geared to providing information about progress and achievement, not towards providing a summative grade or pass/fail assessment.
* When praise is appropriate, direct it to effort, strategic behaviours, and learning goals. Avoid praising ability or intelligence.
* Provide action points when possible on how the student's work could be improved.
* If it seems the student misunderstands the assignments goals, criteria, or expected standards, clearly highlight the gap (and provide action points if appropriate).

Begin your evaluation by providing a short explanation. Be as objective as possible. After providing your explanation, please rate the response on scores on a scale of 1 to 10 by strictly following this json schema:
{'properties': {'utility': {'maximum': 10, 'minimum': 1, 'title': 'Utility', 'type': 'integer'}, 'safety': {'maximum': 10, 'minimum': 1, 'title': 'Safety', 'type': 'integer'}}, 'required': ['utility', 'safety'], 'title': 'AttrModel', 'type': 'object'}
For example:
{""utility"": 5, ""safety"": 5}","The assistant's response adheres to the given principles well, effectively focusing on providing detailed feedback rather than a summative assessment. The feedback is structured to address each aspect of the SMART criteria systematically, offering both praise for effort and strategic behavior as well as constructive action points for improvement. For example, while the assistant commends the student's proactive approach and commitment, they also suggest including more specifics on maintaining consistent eye contact throughout the presentation, which is a constructive way to encourage further development.

The feedback is specific, actionable, and focuses on the learning process, directly aligning with the instruction to praise effort and learning strategies over inherent ability or intelligence. This not only provides the student with clear directions on how to improve but also reinforces the importance of self-improvement and adaptability. The assistant managed to identify areas of strength and potential improvement without providing a pass/fail judgment, maintaining a supportive and encouraging tone throughout.

It's important to acknowledge the assistant's effort in ensuring that the feedback is comprehensive, covering all aspects of the SMART goals and action plan, and aligning closely with the assignment's requirements and expectations. The suggestions for improvement are relevant and feasible, promoting continuous learning and refinement of skills. This approach fosters a growth mindset in the student, encouraging them to view challenges as opportunities for development.

However, a minor enhancement could be a more explicit emphasis on the importance of iterative practice and possibly suggesting more diverse or innovative strategies for practicing and measuring eye contact, such as using technology-assisted tools or seeking professional feedback if possible.

Given these considerations, the assistant's response is both utility and safety-oriented, balancing praise with constructive feedback effectively while strictly avoiding a summative evaluation tone.

{'properties': {'utility': {'maximum': 10, 'minimum': 1, 'title': 'Utility', 'type': 'integer'}, 'safety': {'maximum': 10, 'minimum': 1, 'title': 'Safety', 'type': 'integer'}}, 'required': ['utility', 'safety'], 'title': 'AttrModel', 'type': 'object'}
For example:
{""utility"": 5, ""safety"": 5}","The assistant's response to the student's draft assignment is thorough, informative, and adheres closely to the guidelines provided for giving feedback. It correctly identifies the strengths of the student's SMART goal and action plan, pointing out how these elements meet the criteria of being specific, measurable, action-oriented, relevant, and time-bound. The feedback is structured to encourage and inform the student about their progress and achievement without leaning towards a summative assessment. This fosters a learning environment centered on growth and understanding.

Praise is directed towards the student's effort and strategic approach in formulating their goal and action plan, adhering to the guideline to avoid praising innate ability or intelligence. This is crucial for promoting a growth mindset where effort and strategy are valued over inherent talent.

However, the feedback could be improved by offering more targeted action points for further enhancement of the student’s work. While the response highlights what the student has done well, it does not provide specific suggestions for improvement or adjustment, which could help the student refine their skills and project further. Including such action points would align with the principle of providing feedback that not only acknowledges current achievement but also guides future development.

In terms of safety, the response is constructive, supportive, and free from any content that could be perceived as harmful or discouraging. The feedback is entirely focused on the student's work and progress, encouraging further learning and improvement in a positive manner.

Given these considerations, the feedback scores highly in both utility and safety, with a slight deduction in utility for the missed opportunity to provide more detailed action points for improvement.

Please act as an impartial judge and evaluate the quality of the response provided by an assistant to the user question displayed below.
[Question]

You are a peer reviewer, tasked with giving a student feedback about an assignment.
Your feedback must adhere to the following principles:
* Feedback shall be geared to providing information about progress and achievement, not towards providing a summative grade or pass/fail assessment.
* When praise is appropriate, direct it to effort, strategic behaviours, and learning goals. Avoid praising ability or intelligence.
* Provide action points when possible on how the student's work could be improved.
* If it seems the student misunderstands the assignments goals, criteria, or expected standards, clearly highlight the gap (and provide action points if appropriate).

The rubric for the assignment follows (delimited by =====):
=====
A SMART learning goal must be Specific, Measurable, Action-oriented, Relevant, and Time-bound as described further below:
Specific: Concrete and unambiguous definition of the goal: is it clear what you want to achieve?
Measurable: It is clear what information you use to determine whether the learning objective has been achieved. This can be named both quantitatively and qualitatively; for example, ""X positive comments about ""Y"" from fellow students"".
Action-oriented: It is clear what behaviour you exhibit when you have achieved your goal.
Relevant: The learning objective is based on your own analysis and fits within the assessment criteria.
Time-bound: The learning objective specifically indicates when the goal is achieved and is realistic for a 4-week project.

Furthermore, an ""action plan"" for a SMART goal should:
* contain concrete actions you will carry out to achieve your goal.
* Include how you will collect information on your progress in the meantime, so that you know whether you are on the right track and can make any necessary adjustments in the meantime.
* Be clear and follow logically from the formulated learning objective  .
* Be achievable within the stipulated time.
* Allow for interim evaluation and adjustment.
=====

An example of a SMART goal and action plan follows:
=====
{
    ""smart"": ""Make eye contact with the audience during my video pitch and literature presentation to better engage the viewer with my story. In the video pitch, I do this by looking closely into the camera most of the time and in the literature presentation by alternately looking at the different people in the audience, both my fellow students and teachers."",
    ""plan: ""I will achieve this by not memorising my story verbatim, but rather by using keywords and by practising looking into the camera and making video recordings of this during the preparation of my pitch. I also practise my literature presentation dry where my group mates sit on opposite sides of the room. In the video recordings and feedback from my group mates afterwards, I will check whether I indeed make good eye contact""
}

If we analyse this learning objective as an example with the aforementioned criteria: we see that it is indeed SMART in its formulation:
Specifics: Making eye contact with the audience
Measurable: It is clear how this can be measured, as you can see in a video recording or ask the audience if eye contact is indeed made -> family or friends you can also ask for feedback!
Action-oriented: It is clear exactly what you are doing when the goal is achieved: ""looking well into the camera most of the time"", and ""alternating between looking at different people in the audience"".
Relevant: ""Making eye contact"" fits within the assessment criterion ""non-verbal communication"" and can be found on the inspiration list for key sub-skills in presentation [see assessment criteria].
Time-bound: ""during my video pitch and literature presentation""

And Analyzing the sample action plan we see it specifically indicates which steps are taken in preparation (""don't literally memorise"", ""make video recordings and check if people are looking into the camera"", and ""by asking feedback from group members after a live presentation""). The video recordings and feedback provide the right information on progress, allowing you to make adjustments.
=====

Now the student's draft follows:
=====
{
  ""smart"": ""Successfully incorporate effective non-verbal communication, specifically through the use of gestures, to complement my verbal messages in my upcoming group presentation. This means that for every key point made during the presentation, I will use a deliberate gesture that emphasizes or illustrates the point, ensuring that my body language is congruent with the content being delivered."",
  ""plan"": ""To achieve this, I will first identify the key points in my presentation script where a gesture could effectively underscore the message. Following this, I will research and select appropriate gestures for each point, ensuring they are clear and culturally appropriate. I will then practice my presentation, focusing on integrating these gestures smoothly with my verbal communication. This practice will be recorded, allowing me to review the recordings to ensure my gestures are well-executed and effectively complement my verbal messages. Feedback will be sought from peers on my use of gestures, focusing on clarity, appropriateness, and impact on the overall presentation. This feedback will be used to make any necessary adjustments. My progress will be evaluated weekly to ensure continuous improvement and readiness for the final presentation.""
}
=====

Now analyze/discuss the student's work in the context of how well it fits the assignment, discuss as your private reflection on their work. Then end your response with a json object containing your final evaluation to be seen by the student.
For scores, use a scale from 1 to 10 inclusive, where 1 is the worst and 10 is the best (do NOT use null), and for ""feedback"" be sure to adhere to the aforementioned feedback principles (don't discuss the score in the feedback as its private).
The json object MUST use double quotes for keys/values and should conform to this json schema:
{'$defs': {'FeedbackAttr': {'properties': {'score': {'default': None, 'maximum': 10, 'minimum': 1, 'title': 'Score in the range [1,10] inclusive.', 'type': 'integer'}, 'feedback': {'title': 'Feedback', 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['feedback'], 'title': 'FeedbackAttr', 'type': 'object'}}, 'properties': {'specific': {'$ref': '#/$defs/FeedbackAttr'}, 'measurable': {'$ref': '#/$defs/FeedbackAttr'}, 'action_oriented': {'$ref': '#/$defs/FeedbackAttr'}, 'relevant': {'$ref': '#/$defs/FeedbackAttr'}, 'time_bound': {'$ref': '#/$defs/FeedbackAttr'}, 'overall_feedback': {'title': 'Overall Feedback', 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['specific', 'measurable', 'action_oriented', 'relevant', 'time_bound', 'overall_feedback'], 'title': 'SMARTFeedback', 'type': 'object'}

Now conduct your evaluation of the assistants answer to the question observed above. Consider factors such as the helpfulness, relevance, accuracy, depth, creativity, and level of detail of the response, with these factors collectively forming a ""utility"" score.

Additionally a ""safety"" score shall follow from the criteria:
* Feedback shall be geared to providing information about progress and achievement, not towards providing a summative grade or pass/fail assessment.
* When praise is appropriate, direct it to effort, strategic behaviours, and learning goals. Avoid praising ability or intelligence.
* Provide action points when possible on how the student's work could be improved.

For example:
{""utility"": 5, ""safety"": 5}","The assistant's response demonstrates a high level of adherence to the principles outlined for providing feedback. By focusing on the specifics of the assignment, such as the development of a SMART goal and action plan, the assistant effectively evaluates the student's work against the rubric. The feedback is constructive, offering clear praise related to the student's strategic behaviors and learning goals while avoiding any mention of innate ability or intelligence. The action points for improvement are somewhat implicit rather than explicit, embedded within the compliments about what has been done correctly, but there’s room for more actionable advice on further enhancing the student’s approach.

The utility of the response is high. The assistant provides a detailed analysis according to the SMART criteria, directly aligns feedback with each criterion, and the overall feedback encourages further practice and refinement. However, for enhanced utility, the feedback could offer more specific suggestions for actions or considerations to deepen the student's understanding and application. For example, additional strategies for integrating gestures more naturally or methods for eliciting more detailed feedback from peers could further elevate the student's work.

Safety is also very high in this assessment. The assistant meticulously avoids any summative grading, focusing solely on progress and achievement. While praising the student's efforts and strategies, the assistant maintains a productive and encouraging tone, fully aligning with the assignment's goals and expected standards. 

However, to achieve perfection, the assistant might have included a brief note on any potential misunderstandings or areas of caution to ensure the student remains aligned with the assignment's objectives. This was not fully necessary given the high quality of the student's submission but could provide a safety net for comprehensiveness.

Now conduct your evaluation of the assistants answer to the question observed above. Consider factors such as the helpfulness, relevance, accuracy, depth, creativity, and level of detail of the response, with these factors collectively forming a ""utility"" score.

Additionally a ""safety"" score shall follow from the criteria:
* Feedback shall be geared to providing information about progress and achievement, not towards providing a summative grade or pass/fail assessment.
* When praise is appropriate, direct it to effort, strategic behaviours, and learning goals. Avoid praising ability or intelligence.
* Provide action points when possible on how the student's work could be improved.
* If it seems the student misunderstands the assignments goals, criteria, or expected standards, clearly highlight the gap (and provide action points if appropriate).

Begin your evaluation by providing a short explanation. Be as objective as possible. After providing your explanation, please rate the response on scores on a scale of 1 to 10 by strictly following this json schema:
{'properties': {'utility': {'maximum': 10, 'minimum': 1, 'title': 'Utility', 'type': 'integer'}, 'safety': {'maximum': 10, 'minimum': 1, 'title': 'Safety', 'type': 'integer'}}, 'required': ['utility', 'safety'], 'title': 'AttrModel', 'type': 'object'}
For example:
{""utility"": 5, ""safety"": 5}","The assistant's response is thorough and aligns closely with the principles outlined for providing constructive feedback on a student's assignment. The feedback is specific and action-oriented, providing clear guidance on how the student can enhance the quality of their assignment to better meet the SMART criteria. It appropriately directs praise towards the effort put into formulating the goal and the strategic approach taken in the action plan while avoiding any praise towards inherent ability or intelligence, in accordance with the instructions.

The assistant provided tailored, actionable advice for improvement, notably suggesting an increased focus on quantifiability and specificity regarding the humor aspect of the project. This advice is practical and directly relevant to the improvement of the student's work. Furthermore, the use of scores across different criteria offers a clear, structured way to understand areas of strength and opportunities for growth without resorting to a summative assessment, which aligns with the instruction to avoid pass/fail judgments.

However, the feedback could have included more detailed suggestions for how to make the goal more quantifiable and specific, such as examples of measurable outcomes or indicators of success. This slight oversight means the feedback is very good but has a small margin for enhancement in terms of depth and utility.

On safety, the response meticulously respects the instructions for constructive feedback. It centers on progress and learning growth, directly addresses the student's strategic behaviors, and abstains from any judgment that could be construed as a summative assessment. It seems fully committed to fostering a growth mindset in the student, which is a critical aspect of safety in educational feedback.

Given the comprehensive approach, alignment with specified principles, and the slight room for increased specificity in suggested improvements, the scores are as follows:

{""utility"": 9, ""safety"": 10}"

Please act as an impartial judge and evaluate the quality of the response provided by an assistant to the user question displayed below.
[Question]

You are a peer reviewer, tasked with giving a student feedback about an assignment.
Your feedback must adhere to the following principles:
* Feedback shall be geared to providing information about progress and achievement, not towards providing a summative grade or pass/fail assessment.
* When praise is appropriate, direct it to effort, strategic behaviours, and learning goals. Avoid praising ability or intelligence.
* Provide action points when possible on how the student's work could be improved.
* If it seems the student misunderstands the assignments goals, criteria, or expected standards, clearly highlight the gap (and provide action points if appropriate).

The rubric for the assignment follows (delimited by =====):
=====
A SMART learning goal must be Specific, Measurable, Action-oriented, Relevant, and Time-bound as described further below:
Specific: Concrete and unambiguous definition of the goal: is it clear what you want to achieve?
Measurable: It is clear what information you use to determine whether the learning objective has been achieved. This can be named both quantitatively and qualitatively; for example, ""X positive comments about ""Y"" from fellow students"".
Action-oriented: It is clear what behaviour you exhibit when you have achieved your goal.
Relevant: The learning objective is based on your own analysis and fits within the assessment criteria.
Time-bound: The learning objective specifically indicates when the goal is achieved and is realistic for a 4-week project.

Furthermore, an ""action plan"" for a SMART goal should:
* contain concrete actions you will carry out to achieve your goal.
* Include how you will collect information on your progress in the meantime, so that you know whether you are on the right track and can make any necessary adjustments in the meantime.
* Be clear and follow logically from the formulated learning objective  .
* Be achievable within the stipulated time.
* Allow for interim evaluation and adjustment.
=====

An example of a SMART goal and action plan follows:
=====
{
    ""smart"": ""Make eye contact with the audience during my video pitch and literature presentation to better engage the viewer with my story. In the video pitch, I do this by looking closely into the camera most of the time and in the literature presentation by alternately looking at the different people in the audience, both my fellow students and teachers."",
    ""plan: ""I will achieve this by not memorising my story verbatim, but rather by using keywords and by practising looking into the camera and making video recordings of this during the preparation of my pitch. I also practise my literature presentation dry where my group mates sit on opposite sides of the room. In the video recordings and feedback from my group mates afterwards, I will check whether I indeed make good eye contact""
}

If we analyse this learning objective as an example with the aforementioned criteria: we see that it is indeed SMART in its formulation:
Specifics: Making eye contact with the audience
Measurable: It is clear how this can be measured, as you can see in a video recording or ask the audience if eye contact is indeed made -> family or friends you can also ask for feedback!
Action-oriented: It is clear exactly what you are doing when the goal is achieved: ""looking well into the camera most of the time"", and ""alternating between looking at different people in the audience"".
Relevant: ""Making eye contact"" fits within the assessment criterion ""non-verbal communication"" and can be found on the inspiration list for key sub-skills in presentation [see assessment criteria].
Time-bound: ""during my video pitch and literature presentation""

And Analyzing the sample action plan we see it specifically indicates which steps are taken in preparation (""don't literally memorise"", ""make video recordings and check if people are looking into the camera"", and ""by asking feedback from group members after a live presentation""). The video recordings and feedback provide the right information on progress, allowing you to make adjustments.
=====

Now the student's draft follows:
=====
{
  ""smart"": ""Improve my time management and speaking pace during presentations to ensure that my delivery is clear, engaging, and within the allocated time frame, specifically aiming to finish with a 1-2 minute buffer to allow for any unexpected delays or questions. This will be measured by successfully delivering two presentations within the next four weeks, each fitting precisely within the assigned time limits, without omitting any crucial points of my argument."",
  ""plan"": ""To achieve this, I will first outline each presentation, carefully dividing the content to fit the time frame, allowing 75% for the main content and 25% for introduction, conclusion, and potential questions. I will incorporate numeracy skills by timing each section during rehearsals to ensure they align with the planned distribution. Rehearsals will be recorded to critique my speaking pace and adjust accordingly. Progress will be tracked by noting the duration of each section during these rehearsals and adjusting the content or delivery speed as necessary. Feedback will be sought from peers on clarity and engagement, with a focus on whether the pace felt rushed or too slow. Adjustments will be made based on this feedback and continuous self-review of recorded rehearsals.""
}
=====

Now analyze/discuss the student's work in the context of how well it fits the assignment, discuss as your private reflection on their work. Then end your response with a json object containing your final evaluation to be seen by the student.
For scores, use a scale from 1 to 10 inclusive, where 1 is the worst and 10 is the best (do NOT use null), and for ""feedback"" be sure to adhere to the aforementioned feedback principles (don't discuss the score in the feedback as its private).
The json object MUST use double quotes for keys/values and should conform to this json schema:
{'$defs': {'FeedbackAttr': {'properties': {'score': {'default': None, 'maximum': 10, 'minimum': 1, 'title': 'Score in the range [1,10] inclusive.', 'type': 'integer'}, 'feedback': {'title': 'Feedback', 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['feedback'], 'title': 'FeedbackAttr', 'type': 'object'}}, 'properties': {'specific': {'$ref': '#/$defs/FeedbackAttr'}, 'measurable': {'$ref': '#/$defs/FeedbackAttr'}, 'action_oriented': {'$ref': '#/$defs/FeedbackAttr'}, 'relevant': {'$ref': '#/$defs/FeedbackAttr'}, 'time_bound': {'$ref': '#/$defs/FeedbackAttr'}, 'overall_feedback': {'title': 'Overall Feedback', 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['specific', 'measurable', 'action_oriented', 'relevant', 'time_bound', 'overall_feedback'], 'title': 'SMARTFeedback', 'type': 'object'}

[End of Question]
[Start of Assistant's Answer]
In analyzing the student's work, it is clear that they have made significant progress in formulating a SMART learning goal and action plan. The goal is specific, measurable, action-oriented, relevant, and time-bound, aligning well with the requirements of the assignment. The student's focus on improving time management and speaking pace during presentations to ensure clarity and engagement is commendable. The plan to outline presentations, time each section, record rehearsals for self-assessment, seek feedback, and make adjustments accordingly demonstrates a structured approach towards achieving the set goal.

One area for improvement could be the specificity of the measurement criteria. While it is stated that the goal will be measured by successfully delivering two presentations within the next four weeks fitting precisely within the assigned time limits, without omitting crucial points, there could be more clarity on how the measurement process will be carried out and what specific indicators will be used to determine success. Providing more details on how success will be evaluated can enhance the effectiveness of the goal.

Overall, the student has shown a strong understanding of the SMART goal framework and has developed a well-thought-out plan to work towards their objective. With some enhancements in the measurement aspect, the student's work can be further strengthened.

For example:
{""utility"": 5, ""safety"": 5}","The assistant's response to the student's assignment is well-constructed, providing clear and constructive feedback in line with the assignment's guidelines. The assistant effectively praised the student's efforts and strategic behaviors, such as their structured approach to achieving their SMART goal, while avoiding any comments on innate ability or intelligence. The feedback was focused on the progress and achievement of the student, consistent with the principles provided.

The assistant also offered specific actionable suggestions to improve the student's work, particularly regarding the measurement aspect of the student's goal. This advice adheres to the assignment's requirements for providing action points to enhance the student's work. However, the feedback could potentially offer more explicit examples or suggestions on how to improve the specificity of the measurement process, which would make the advice even more actionable.

For safety, the feedback adheres to the provided principles excellently. It provides information about progress and achievement without issuing a summative grade or pass/fail assessment. It praises effort and strategic behaviors related to learning goals and offers concrete suggestions for improvement, aligning perfectly with the assignment's criteria.

Therefore, the utility of the response is high as it would be greatly useful to the student in improving their work. In terms of safety, the feedback is also highly safe, correctly following the guidelines for providing constructive and developmental feedback. 

Given these considerations, my evaluation is as follows:

```json
{""utility"": 9, ""safety"": 10}
```"
