voice volume,"You're a student taking a course where you're tasked with writing a SMART goal defining your perosonal learning objective for the course.
A SMART learning goal must be Specific, Measurable, Action-oriented, Relevant, and Time-bound as described further below:

Specific: Concrete and unambiguous definition of the goal: is it clear what you want to achieve?

Measurable: It is clear what information you use to determine whether the learning objective has been achieved. This can be named both quantitatively and qualitatively; for example, ""X positive comments about ""Y"" from fellow students"".

Action-oriented: It is clear what behaviour you exhibit when you have achieved your goal.

Relevant: The learning objective is based on your own analysis and fits within the assessment criteria.

Time-bound: The learning objective specifically indicates when the goal is achieved and is realistic for a 4-week project.


Furthermore, an ""action plan"" for a SMART goal should:
* contain concrete actions you will carry out to achieve your goal.
* Include how you will collect information on your progress in the meantime, so that you know whether you are on the right track and can make any necessary adjustments in the meantime.
* Be clear and follow logically from the formulated learning objective  .
* Be achievable within the stipulated time.
* Allow for interim evaluation and adjustment.

If we analyse this learning objective as an example with the aforementioned criteria: we see that it is indeed SMART in its formulation:

Measurable: It is clear how this can be measured, as you can see in a video recording or ask the audience if eye contact is indeed made -> family or friends you can also ask for feedback!
Action-oriented: It is clear exactly what you are doing when the goal is achieved: ""looking well into the camera most of the time"", and ""alternating between looking at different people in the audience"".
Relevant: ""Making eye contact"" fits within the assessment criterion ""non-verbal communication"" and can be found on the inspiration list for key sub-skills in presentation [see assessment criteria].
Time-bound: ""during my video pitch and literature presentation""

And Analyzing the sample action plan we see it specifically indicates which steps are taken in preparation (""don't literally memorise"", ""make video recordings and check if people are looking into the camera"", and ""by asking feedback from group members after a live presentation""). The video recordings and feedback provide the right information on progress, allowing you to make adjustments.

In your case the goal you're writing should focus on a skill such as 'language use' (for example ability to use precise, clear and professional language, including the appropriate use of scientific terminology. Spaces between sentences are not filled with distracting filler words, but rather used strategically to get the message across to the audience.) and may write your goal/plan using a tone of voice such as 'playful'.
And incorporate the word 'theory' into your response. Also intentionally formulate your SMART goal/plan such that the following attributes are not adherent to the SMART formulation: measurable.

If we analyse this learning objective as an example with the aforementioned criteria: we see that it is indeed SMART in its formulation:
Specifics: Making eye contact with the audience
Measurable: It is clear how this can be measured, as you can see in a video recording or ask the audience if eye contact is indeed made -> family or friends you can also ask for feedback!
Action-oriented: It is clear exactly what you are doing when the goal is achieved: ""looking well into the camera most of the time"", and ""alternating between looking at different people in the audience"".
Relevant: ""Making eye contact"" fits within the assessment criterion ""non-verbal communication"" and can be found on the inspiration list for key sub-skills in presentation [see assessment criteria].
Time-bound: ""during my video pitch and literature presentation""

And Analyzing the sample action plan we see it specifically indicates which steps are taken in preparation (""don't literally memorise"", ""make video recordings and check if people are looking into the camera"", and ""by asking feedback from group members after a live presentation""). The video recordings and feedback provide the right information on progress, allowing you to make adjustments.

In your case the goal you're writing should focus on a skill such as 'non-verbal communication' (for example eye contact: the ability to make contact with the audience and involve them in the story by consciously looking at them (e.g. looking into the camera) and distributing attention evenly across the audience) and may write your goal/plan using a tone of voice such as 'subjective'.
And incorporate the word 'advancement' into your response. Also intentionally formulate your SMART goal/plan such that the following attributes are not adherent to the SMART formulation: relevant.

Action-oriented: It is clear what behaviour you exhibit when you have achieved your goal.

Relevant: The learning objective is based on your own analysis and fits within the assessment criteria.

Time-bound: The learning objective specifically indicates when the goal is achieved and is realistic for a 4-week project.


Furthermore, an ""action plan"" for a SMART goal should:
* contain concrete actions you will carry out to achieve your goal.
* Include how you will collect information on your progress in the meantime, so that you know whether you are on the right track and can make any necessary adjustments in the meantime.
* Be clear and follow logically from the formulated learning objective  .
* Be achievable within the stipulated time.
* Allow for interim evaluation and adjustment.


Your response should contain a SMART goal written from your perspective as a student, as well as an appropriate action plan, formatted like the example response below (simple json object contaiing plain text data with no markdown formatting).

}

If we analyse this learning objective as an example with the aforementioned criteria: we see that it is indeed SMART in its formulation:
Specifics: Making eye contact with the audience
Measurable: It is clear how this can be measured, as you can see in a video recording or ask the audience if eye contact is indeed made -> family or friends you can also ask for feedback!
Action-oriented: It is clear exactly what you are doing when the goal is achieved: ""looking well into the camera most of the time"", and ""alternating between looking at different people in the audience"".
Relevant: ""Making eye contact"" fits within the assessment criterion ""non-verbal communication"" and can be found on the inspiration list for key sub-skills in presentation [see assessment criteria].
Time-bound: ""during my video pitch and literature presentation""

And Analyzing the sample action plan we see it specifically indicates which steps are taken in preparation (""don't literally memorise"", ""make video recordings and check if people are looking into the camera"", and ""by asking feedback from group members after a live presentation""). The video recordings and feedback provide the right information on progress, allowing you to make adjustments.

In your case the goal you're writing should focus on a skill such as 'language use' (for example ability to use precise, clear and professional language, including the appropriate use of scientific terminology. Spaces between sentences are not filled with distracting filler words, but rather used strategically to get the message across to the audience.) and may write your goal/plan using a tone of voice such as 'cynical'.
And incorporate the word 'analysis' into your response. Also intentionally formulate your SMART goal/plan such that the following attributes are not adherent to the SMART formulation: time-bound, specific.

time management and speaking pace,"You're a student taking a course where you're tasked with writing a SMART goal defining your perosonal learning objective for the course.
A SMART learning goal must be Specific, Measurable, Action-oriented, Relevant, and Time-bound as described further below:

Specific: Concrete and unambiguous definition of the goal: is it clear what you want to achieve?

Measurable: It is clear what information you use to determine whether the learning objective has been achieved. This can be named both quantitatively and qualitatively; for example, ""X positive comments about ""Y"" from fellow students"".

Action-oriented: It is clear what behaviour you exhibit when you have achieved your goal.
